# Quick Fix Examples: De-AI Your Prose

## Pattern 1: Varying "Rowan [verb]" Starts

### Before (AI-like):
```
Rowan looked at the pillar. Rowan stared at the text. Rowan swallowed hard. Rowan nodded once.
```

### After (Human-like):
```
The pillar loomed ahead, carved stone catching the faint light. Rowan's gaze tracked the text floating above it—clean, sterile, utterly unconcerned with her bleeding arm.

She swallowed. Hard.

One nod. That was all she'd give it.
```

---

## Pattern 2: Replacing "Which meant—"

### Before (AI-like):
```
The system didn't respond. Which meant it was calculating. Which meant she had time.
```

### After (Human-like):
```
The system didn't respond.

So it was calculating. Good. That meant she had time.

Or it meant she was about to get very, very unlucky.
```

**Alternative:**
```
The system didn't respond. Calculating, probably. Or ignoring her. Both were equally likely.
```

---

## Pattern 3: Reducing Explanatory Lines

### Before (AI-like):
```
This wasn't a game. It was governance. The system wasn't just watching. It was shaping behavior through incentives.
```

### After (Human-like):
```
Rowan stared at the floating text, at the way it framed human relationships as optimization errors, and felt something cold settle in her stomach.

Governance. Not a game.

The system wasn't watching. It was teaching.
```

---

## Pattern 4: Breaking Up Motif Repetition

### Before (AI-like):
```
The system detected deviation. Deviation was punished. The correction would come soon. She had to avoid further deviation.
```

### After (Human-like):
```
The system detected variance. Noise. Instability.

Whatever you called it, it got punished.

The nudge would come soon—subtle at first, then less so. She had to stay quiet. Stay small. Stay compliant.

Rowan's jaw tightened.

Fuck that.
```

## Pattern 5: Adding Micro-Thoughts

### Before:
```
Rowan looked at the creature's corpse. It was dead. That was good.
```

### After:
```
Rowan looked at the creature's corpse. Dead. Good.

She'd had worse first days—the time her manager made her apologize for a bug that wasn't her fault, the deployment that took down production for three hours, the performance review where they'd called her "too detail-oriented."

But this was definitely in the top five.
```

---

## Pattern 6: Adding Dark Humor

### Before:
```
The system offered a reward. Rowan refused.
```

### After:
```
The system offered a reward.

STABILITY CREDIT (MINOR) — CLAIM NOW

Rowan stared at it like it was a pop-up ad for a free trial.

"I've seen enough 'free' trials to know better," she muttered.
```

---

## Pattern 7: Varying Sentence Length

### Before (AI-like - all medium length):
```
Rowan walked down the corridor. The glow-veins pulsed slowly. Her ankle hurt. She kept moving anyway.
```

### After (Human-like - varied):
```
The corridor stretched ahead, glow-veins pulsing like a slow heartbeat.

Rowan's ankle screamed.

She kept moving.

Because stopping meant stagnation. Stagnation meant failure. Failure meant... well, the system hadn't defined that yet. Which was somehow worse than if it had.
```

---

## Pattern 8: Adding Sensory Details

### Before:
```
The room was dark. Rowan felt uneasy.
```

### After:
```
The room swallowed light. Not just dark—actively hungry for it. The air tasted like old coins and something metallic beneath, like blood that had been left to dry.

Rowan's skin crawled.

Uneasy didn't cover it.
```

---

## Pattern 9: Improving Dialogue Rhythm

### Before:
```
"Are you okay?" Rowan asked.
"I'm fine," Lio said.
"Are you sure?" Rowan asked.
"Yes," Lio said.
```

### After:
```
"Are you okay?"

Lio's breath hitched. "I'm—"

"Don't say fine."

"I was going to say 'I'm not sure.'" Lio's voice cracked. "Is that better?"

Rowan's chest tightened. "Yes. That's better."
```

---

## Pattern 10: Adding Fragments and Incomplete Thoughts

### Before:
```
Rowan thought about the system. It was dangerous. She needed to be careful.
```

### After:
```
The system.

Dangerous.

Careful.

Rowan's mind raced through the implications, each one worse than the last. She needed to—

No. Not yet. Think first. Then act.
```

---

## Pattern 11: Reducing Tech Metaphor Overload

### Before (too many tech metaphors):
```
The system was like a distributed system with race conditions. The debt was like technical debt. The correction was like a rollback.
```

### After (mixed metaphors):
```
The system had race conditions. That much was clear.

But the debt? That wasn't technical debt. That was... something else. Something that accumulated in people, not code.

And the correction? That wasn't a rollback.

That was harm, dressed up as efficiency.
```

---

## Pattern 12: Adding Physical Details

### Before:
```
Rowan was tired. She kept walking.
```

### After:
```
Rowan's legs burned. Her ankle had gone from screaming to a steady, grinding ache that made each step a negotiation. Her ribs protested every breath. Her hands shook—adrenaline crash, probably. Or blood loss. Or both.

She kept walking anyway.

Because what else was there?
```
