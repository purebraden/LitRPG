# Flow and Continuity Review

## Overall Assessment
The book has strong character development and narrative progression, but several chapter transitions need smoothing to eliminate awkward jumps that could confuse readers.

---

## Critical Issues

### 1. Chapter 14 → Chapter 15 (Aftermath → The Healing)
**Issue:** Chapter 14 ends with "They moved on. Slower now. Heavier. But together." Chapter 15 starts with "They stayed in the alcove for three days." The alcove appears out of nowhere—there's no mention of finding or choosing this alcove in Chapter 14.

**Fix Needed:** Add a brief bridge at the end of Chapter 14 or beginning of Chapter 15 establishing:
- They found/hid in an alcove
- Why they stopped (Kellan's condition, need to rest, etc.)
- The decision to stay and let him heal

**Impact:** Medium-High (confusing jump in location/time)

---

### 2. Prologue → Chapter 1
**Issue:** Both cover the fall sequence, creating some redundancy. However, this might be intentional—the prologue is the "last normal moment" and Chapter 1 is the immediate aftermath. 

**Assessment:** This actually works fine—the prologue ends with the impact/darkness, and Chapter 1 starts with assessing damage. But worth reviewing to ensure Chapter 1 reads well for readers who skip the prologue (as some do).

**Impact:** Low (redundancy is acceptable here)

---

## Moderate Issues

### 3. Chapter 15 → Chapter 16 (The Healing → Anomalous Persistence)
**Issue:** Chapter 15 ends with them starting to move again, walking through the corridor. Chapter 16 starts with "The system started lagging" and mentions Kellan's weight between them. The transition is functional but could be smoother—we jump immediately into noticing system lag without establishing that they've been walking for a while.

**Fix Needed:** Add 1-2 sentences at the start of Chapter 16 establishing they've been walking for some time, or reference the passage of time more explicitly.

**Impact:** Low-Medium (minor smoothing needed)

---

### 4. Chapter 13 → Chapter 14 (The Price → Aftermath)
**Status:** ✅ Good transition. Chapter 13 ends with Kellan's correction/consequence, Chapter 14 immediately picks up the aftermath. Clear continuity.

---

### 5. Chapter 21 → Epilogue
**Issue:** Chapter 21 ends with entering the city. Epilogue jumps to "Three days after entering the city." This is a significant time jump that might feel abrupt.

**Assessment:** Actually works well—the epilogue is meant to be a time jump to show adaptation. But worth checking that the epilogue opening feels natural and doesn't leave readers feeling like they missed something important.

**Impact:** Low (time jumps in epilogues are standard)

---

## Minor Issues / Consistency Checks Needed

### 6. Character Knowledge Consistency
**Check:** Ensure Rowan's knowledge of the System builds logically throughout—she shouldn't know things too early, and information revealed later should align with what she's observed.

### 7. System Behavior Consistency
**Check:** System responses should be consistent with established rules. For example, if the System "isolates" Rowan in Chapter 18, subsequent chapters should reflect that limitation.

### 8. Physical State Tracking
**Check:** Rowan's injuries (ankle brace, etc.) should be consistent and referenced appropriately throughout.

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Chapter 14 → 15 Transition
Add bridge text establishing the alcove and the decision to stop.

### Priority 2: Smooth Chapter 15 → 16 Transition  
Add brief setup at start of Chapter 16 about walking/having traveled.

### Priority 3: Review Consistency
Spot-check for character knowledge, system behavior, and physical state consistency.

## Positive Notes
- Chapter 13 → 14 transition is excellent
- Most chapter endings create good hooks
- Pacing generally feels natural
- Character emotional arcs flow well
