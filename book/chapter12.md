# Chapter 12
## Forced Efficiency

The left corridor punished them immediately.

The stone became uneven, jagged. The glow-veins dimmed to a sickly pulse that made shadows jump. The air grew colder, and the damp smell turned sharp—like old metal and something burnt.

Rowan’s ankle slipped once, and pain flashed hot enough to make her stumble. Kellan caught her elbow before she hit the wall.

“Careful,” he muttered.

Rowan nodded, teeth clenched. “Noted.”

Lio whispered, “It feels… wrong.”

Rowan didn’t argue. “That’s how you know it’s ours.”

They walked for what felt like an hour. Then the corridor opened into a chamber with a bridge.

A narrow stone bridge, arching over a black drop that swallowed the glow from the walls. The bridge had no rails. No safety. Just a thin span and the promise that gravity still worked here.

On the far side of the bridge stood a gate—metal bars set into stone, with the familiar spiral-line symbol etched into the frame.

Rowan’s overlay appeared, sharp and immediate.

OBJECTIVE UPDATE: PROCEED TO GATE
PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS: 43%
NOTE: COHORT SIZE CREATES RISK

Kellan swore softly. “It wants us to go one at a time.”

Lio’s voice was thin. “I can’t— I can’t cross that.”

Rowan stared at the bridge.

A memory hit her: a childhood field trip to a ropes course, her stomach lurching at the height, her teacher’s cheerful voice saying, “You’re safe!” while Rowan stared at fraying rope and thought, That’s not safety, that’s optimism.

Same feeling now.

Rowan stepped closer to the bridge’s edge and peered down.

Nothing. Just darkness. No glint of water, no hint of floor. An absence that felt like a mouth.

Kellan’s voice went low. “We don’t have to do this.”

Rowan’s overlay flickered.

FAILURE CONDITION: STAGNATION RISK INCREASING
NOTE: NON-PROGRESS WILL TRIGGER CORRECTION

There it was. The trap.

If they didn’t cross, they’d be corrected.
If they crossed together, cohort size risk.
If they crossed one by one… the system’s preferred option.

Separate the team.

Rowan’s jaw clenched.

A soft sound came from behind them—footsteps.

Rowan turned sharply, pain flaring.

A figure emerged from the corridor they’d come through. Someone older, shoulders hunched, hair gray and tangled. Their clothes were layered like they’d been cold for a long time.

They stopped when they saw Rowan’s group and lifted their hands.

“Please,” the stranger said, voice hoarse. “Don’t send me back.”

Rowan froze.

Kellan’s eyes narrowed. “Who are you?”

The stranger swallowed. “I’m… I’m Nessa.”

Rowan’s overlay flickered.

NEW ENTITY: NESSA
STATUS: MARKED
NOTE: CORRECTION BAIT LIKELY

Rowan felt cold settle in her stomach.

The system had sent them.

Or allowed them.

Or timed them.

Nessa took one step forward, trembling. “I saw your light. I followed. I don’t want to be alone.”

Lio’s face softened instinctively. “Rowan…”

Kellan’s jaw tightened. “No.”

Rowan stared at Nessa, at the desperation, at the raw need.

And she felt the system offer the clean solution like a gift.

SUGGESTED ACTION: TRANSFER MARKED ENTITY
REWARD: DEBT REDUCTION / PROBABILITY INCREASE
NOTE: EFFICIENCY IMPROVES WHEN COHORT OFFLOADS RISK

Rowan’s mouth went dry.

It wanted her to use Nessa.

It wanted her to hand Nessa to the gate like an offering.

Rowan could almost see the logic tree: the marked one crosses first, triggers whatever trap exists, dies or clears the way, and the “valuable” cohort proceeds.

That’s what the system meant by efficiency.

Rowan’s stomach turned.

Nessa’s eyes flicked between them, pleading. “Please. Please. I’ll do anything.”

Rowan closed her eyes for half a second.

Earth memory: Rowan in a conference room, watching a junior engineer take blame for an outage because leadership wanted a name. Rowan had stayed quiet. It had been easier. She’d told herself she was protecting her own job.

She’d gone home that night and stared at her ceiling for hours, feeling like something inside her had corroded.

Never again.

Rowan opened her eyes and looked at Nessa.

“No,” Rowan said softly.

Nessa blinked, confused. “No?”

Rowan stepped forward carefully. “No deals. No offerings. You don’t have to ‘do anything.’ You just have to tell me the truth.”

Nessa’s lips trembled. “What truth?”

Rowan pointed at the bridge. “What happens when someone crosses?”

Nessa’s face crumpled. “It— it moves.”

Rowan’s pulse thudded. “The bridge moves.”

Nessa nodded rapidly. “It shifts. It— it tilts. It— it makes you fall if you— if you—”

“If you’re not alone?” Rowan guessed.

Nessa shook their head violently. “If you’re heavy.”

Rowan froze.

Kellan’s eyes narrowed. “Heavy?”

Nessa’s voice broke. “If you carry anyone. If you try to help. If you— if you slow down.”

Rowan’s overlay flickered as if amused.

NOTE: BRIDGE LOAD LIMITS ENFORCE EFFICIENT TRANSIT

Rowan’s jaw clenched so hard her teeth ached.

Of course. The bridge was designed to punish care. To punish helping the injured. To punish carrying a companion.

Rowan looked at Lio—thin, bruised, already trembling.

Lio whispered, “I can walk. I can.”

Rowan believed them. And also didn’t. Fear makes people say anything.

Kellan’s voice was low. “We can cross one at a time.”

Rowan nodded slowly. “Yes.”

Then: “But we don’t leave anyone behind.”

Kellan looked at her. “How?”

Rowan stared at the bridge. The gate. The symbol. The absence below.

An idea formed, not clever—just stubborn.

“We reduce load,” Rowan said quietly.

Kellan blinked. “By doing what?”

Rowan turned to Nessa. “How long have you been here?”

Nessa swallowed. “Long.”

Rowan nodded. “Then you know something. How do you cross if you’re injured?”

Nessa’s eyes widened. “You don’t.”

Rowan’s stomach twisted. “That’s the point.”

Rowan looked at Kellan. “Give me the bandages Aster gave us.”

Kellan hesitated, then handed them over.

Rowan tore strips quickly, fingers working despite pain. She wrapped one strip around Lio’s waist, another around her own. Then she wrapped around Kellan’s wrist.

A crude tether. Not to carry. Not to pull someone up.

To keep distance. To prevent a fall from becoming a death.

Kellan stared. “That won’t reduce load.”

Rowan shook her head. “No. It reduces loss.”

The system didn’t care about loss. Rowan did.

Rowan stepped onto the bridge.

The stone under her foot felt normal for half a second.

Then it shifted.

A subtle tilt, like the bridge was testing her balance. Rowan’s ankle screamed. She bit down on a gasp.

Behind her, Lio whimpered.

Rowan spread her arms slightly for balance and took another step.

The bridge tilted again, more aggressively this time.

Rowan’s overlay flashed.

WARNING: INEFFICIENT TRANSIT DETECTED
SUGGESTION: INCREASE SPEED / REDUCE COHORT DEPENDENCE

Rowan exhaled sharply. “Go to hell.”

She moved faster, just enough to satisfy physics, not the system. One step, then another.

Halfway across, the bridge tilted hard to the left.

Lio shrieked behind her.

Rowan felt the tether yank as Lio stumbled.

Rowan planted her foot, pain exploding, and leaned back, anchoring.

Kellan grabbed Lio’s arm, keeping them upright.

The bridge steadied—reluctant, like an animal that didn’t like being controlled.

Rowan swallowed, heart hammering.

She looked forward. The gate was close.

Ten steps.

Rowan took them, forcing her body through pain.

At the gate, she pressed her palm to the symbol.

Warm stone. Alive-warm.

The seam in the gate shivered—then slid open just enough for a person to squeeze through.

Rowan turned back, breath ragged.

“Lio,” she called. “Now. One step at a time. Don’t look down.”

Lio nodded, terrified, and stepped onto the bridge.

The bridge tilted.

Lio froze.

Rowan’s overlay offered the clean solution again, sweet and quiet.

SUGGESTED ACTION: RELEASE COHORT TETHER
NOTE: RISK REDUCTION / PROBABILITY INCREASE

Rowan’s mouth went tight.

She remembered the conference room. The junior engineer. The silence.

Rowan tightened her grip on the tether.

“No,” she whispered.

She anchored, leaning back, taking Lio’s weight through the cloth as they moved forward one trembling step at a time.

Kellan followed behind, steadying.

Nessa hovered at the chamber edge, shaking.

Rowan met Nessa’s eyes. “You too.”

Nessa blinked. “What?”

Rowan’s voice was rough. “We don’t leave you here.”

Kellan shot Rowan a look. “Rowan—”

Rowan didn’t look away. “We don’t.”

The bridge tilted again—harder now, like it disliked her decision.

Rowan’s overlay flashed.

CORRECTIVE INFLUENCE: ESCALATING
NOTE: THIS WILL IMPROVE EFFICIENCY

Rowan’s hands shook.

Not from fear. From rage.

“Then be inefficient,” Rowan whispered.

And she held the tether tight while Lio crossed.

While Kellan crossed.

And then, when they were both through the gate, Rowan looked back across the yawning dark and held out the cloth strip.

“Nessa,” Rowan called. “Come on.”

Nessa stepped onto the bridge, trembling.

The bridge tilted.

Rowan braced.

The system had forced the scenario. Forced the “efficient” choice.

Rowan chose wrong.

On purpose.

And she could feel, like an oncoming migraine, that the system was going to collect.

Soon.
