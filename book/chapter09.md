# Chapter 9
## The Optimizers

They found the optimizers an hour later.

Not because they were looking for them—because the corridor deposited them into a bright, clean chamber with banners.

Actual banners.

Cloth hanging from the ceiling, dyed a pale, serene blue. Symbols embroidered in tidy lines. A ring of people sitting cross-legged in a circle, hands resting on knees, eyes closed.

It looked like a wellness retreat designed by someone who’d never been genuinely tired.

Rowan stopped at the threshold.

Kellan muttered, “Oh no.”

Lio whispered, “They look… peaceful.”

Rowan’s stomach turned. “So do cults.”

A man in the circle opened his eyes and smiled.

The smile was soft. Kind. Practiced.

“Welcome,” he said warmly. “You’re safe here.”

Rowan didn’t move. “That’s a bold claim.”

He chuckled lightly, like she’d made a cute joke. “We work with the Path.”

Rowan’s overlay flickered before she could stop herself from checking it.

NODE: ALIGNMENT SANCTUM
ACCESS: OPEN
NOTE: HIGH COMPLIANCE ZONE

Rowan felt her skin crawl.

The man stood gracefully. He wore a tunic that fit too well for a world of scavenged clothing. His hair was clean. His nails were clean.

He extended a hand. “I’m Brother Halden.”

Brother.

Rowan’s eyebrows lifted. “You’re from Earth and you’re calling yourself Brother?”

Halden’s smile didn’t falter. “Names are for identities. Identities are… burdens. Here, we become what the Path needs.”

Rowan glanced at the people in the circle. One was a young woman with a shaved head, face serene. Another was an older guy with a beard and tired eyes that didn’t match the calm expression he was wearing.

Rowan felt a flash of memory: an all-hands meeting, camera grid of faces, everyone nodding along while leadership announced layoffs. She’d watched her coworkers’ expressions—how still they went, how carefully neutral, as if emotion would cost them their job.

Same stillness. Different room.

Kellan’s voice was low. “Don’t.”

Rowan murmured, “I wasn’t going to.”

Halden’s gaze flicked over them, gentle as a scanning tool. “You’ve brought noise with you.”

Rowan’s jaw tightened. “Noise?”

Halden sighed, sympathetically. “Deviation. Resistance. The system corrects because it must. It keeps the world stable.”

Rowan laughed once, sharp. “Tell that to the people it crushes.”

Halden’s smile softened into pity. “Ah.”

Pity. The fastest way to make Rowan angry.

“Come,” Halden said, still kind. “Sit. Drink. Rest. You’re injured.”

Lio shifted forward instinctively. Then froze, glancing at Rowan.

Rowan studied Halden. “What’s the cost?”

Halden blinked like he hadn’t considered that question in years. “The cost… is acceptance.”

Rowan’s overlay updated.

SUGGESTED ACTION: ACCEPT ALIGNMENT
REWARD: STABILITY CREDIT (MODERATE)
NOTE: COMPLIANCE REDUCES DEBT LOAD

Rowan’s heart thudded.

Of course it did.

The system was offering a debt consolidation plan.

Rowan’s mouth went dry. Her ankle hurt so badly she could taste it. The thought of moderate stabilization was a warm, seductive thing.

And that terrified her.

Halden gestured toward the circle again. “We don’t fight. We don’t bargain. We listen.”

Kellan’s voice was rough. “And what happens when the Path says to leave someone behind?”

Halden’s expression didn’t change. “Then you leave them.”

Lio made a small choking sound.

Rowan felt cold spread through her chest.

Halden continued gently, “Attachment creates inefficiency. Inefficiency creates suffering. You want to end suffering, yes?”

Rowan heard herself say, without raising her voice, “You’re describing anesthetic death.”

Halden’s smile faltered for the first time. “No. We’re describing peace.”

Rowan shook her head. “Peace without choice is sedation.”

Halden’s eyes narrowed slightly. Not angry. Just… corrected. “You’ve been visible, haven’t you.”

Rowan didn’t answer.

Halden stepped closer. “It’s a heavy gift. We can help you carry it.”

Rowan’s overlay flickered with another temptation.

REWARD AVAILABLE: STABILITY CREDIT (MODERATE)
NOTE: CLAIMING WILL REDUCE CORRECTIVE PRESSURE ON COHORT

Kellan’s shoulders sagged, just a fraction, as if he could feel the offer even without seeing it. “Rowan… I feel it. Like… like if we stay, it’ll stop.”

Rowan’s throat tightened.

She remembered another night on-call, years ago. She’d been so tired her hands shook when she typed. The incident channel was full of messages: “Any updates?” “ETA?” “Can we roll back?” She’d stared at her screen and thought, if I just shut my laptop, it stops. The alerts stop. The blame stops. I can sleep.

She hadn’t shut it. She’d kept going, because someone downstream would get hurt if she didn’t.

Same shape. Different stakes.

Rowan looked at Lio.

Lio looked back with raw, pleading hope. “Can we just… rest?”

Rowan’s heart squeezed.

“Not here,” Rowan said softly.

Halden’s voice stayed kind. “Why not? We won’t harm you.”

Rowan met his eyes. “You already did.”

She pointed at the circle with her chin. “Look at them.”

Halden’s smile returned, almost sad. “They’re free.”

Rowan’s voice went quiet. “They’re gone.”

Halden’s eyes flashed—an instant, sharp and human. Then the calm settled back over him like a blanket.

“That’s your fear speaking,” he said.

Rowan nodded. “Yes.”

And then: “And my pattern recognition.”

Halden’s gaze sharpened. “If you refuse, the system will correct you again.”

Rowan shrugged, careful, because her ribs still ached. “Let it try.”

Halden exhaled. “Then at least take the Stabil—”

“No,” Rowan said, cutting him off.

She felt the craving for relief in her own body. The humiliating urge to accept. To stop.

Rowan hated that she wanted it.

She looked at the circle again, at the people sitting so still, and she knew—deep in her bones—that the system wasn’t just rewarding them. It was consuming them.

Rowan turned away.

“Come on,” she said to Kellan and Lio.

Lio didn’t move.

Rowan paused, heart thudding, and looked back.

Lio’s gaze was locked on the circle, on the calm faces. “It looks… easier.”

Rowan walked back to them and lowered her voice. “It is.”

Lio swallowed. “Then why—”

“Because it’s not yours,” Rowan said. “It’s something they sold.”

Lio’s eyes filled. “I’m so tired.”

Rowan’s throat tightened. She nodded once, acknowledging it.

Then she did something she hadn’t planned.

She reached into her pocket and pulled out the scrap of creature membrane—the last bit she’d used to brace her ankle.

She pressed it into Lio’s palm.

Lio blinked. “What is—”

“A reminder,” Rowan said. “You fought. You didn’t just comply. That matters.”

Lio’s fingers curled around it.

Rowan squeezed their hand once. “Come with me.”

Lio inhaled shakily, then nodded.

They turned away from the circle.

Halden’s voice followed them, still gentle. “The Path is patient. You’ll come back when you’re ready to stop suffering.”

Rowan didn’t look back.

“We’ll come back,” she murmured to herself, “when you’re ready to stop calling it peace.”
