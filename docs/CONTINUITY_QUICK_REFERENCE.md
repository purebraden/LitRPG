# Continuity Quick Reference
## Fracture Protocol Series - Key Consistency Points

**Purpose:** Quick reference for maintaining consistency while writing

---

## Character Arc Tracking

### Kellan's Alignment Timeline
- **Book 1, Ch 13:** Gets corrected, partially recovers
- **Book 2, Ch 5:** **ALIGNS** (strategy-driven, feels like relief)
- **Book 3:** Alignment deepens, becomes more System-like, still fighting
- **Book 4:** Still aligned but fighting, helps with strategy
- **Book 5:** Still aligned but fighting, helps with strategy
- **Book 6, Ch 2:** **REDEMPTION** - rejects alignment, withdrawal, recovery

**Key Point:** Alignment is gradual, not sudden. Withdrawal is costly.

---

### Rowan's Empathy Cost Escalation
- **Book 2:** Cost established (aftermath time, emotional contamination, System attention)
- **Book 3:** Cost increases in empathy-resistant zones
- **Book 4:** Cost remains consistent
- **Book 5:** Cost peaks (empathy on System) - **MUST LINGER**
- **Book 6:** Cost lingers (delayed recovery, altered perception, reduced capacity)

**Key Point:** Empathy cost never goes away. Scars remain visible.

---

### Jordan's Recovery Timeline
- **Book 4, Ch 4:** Introduced, partial alignment struggle
- **Book 4, Ch 6:** Alignment flares, resists, recovers partially
- **Book 5:** Technical expertise, alignment improves
- **Book 6, Ch 4:** **Full recovery** (withdrawal, healing)
- **Book 6, Ch 15:** **Becomes bridge** between worlds

**Key Point:** Recovery is possible but costly. Alignment withdrawal hurts.

---

### Nova's Trauma Timeline
- **Book 4, Ch 8:** Rescued, traumatized (near-alignment experience)
- **Book 4, Ch 12:** Trauma persists (long tail, don't rush)
- **Book 5:** Recovering slowly
- **Book 6:** Recovered enough to function (trauma scars remain)

**Key Point:** Trauma is a long tail. Don't fully resolve it. Scars remain.

## System Mechanics Consistency

### Empathy
- **Always:** Bidirectional, costly, not a skill (residual effect)
- **System:** Cannot fully classify it, exhibits uncertainty
- **Cost:** Escalates appropriately, never goes away completely

### Residual Permissions
- **Nature:** Side effects of resistance, not buffs
- **Properties:** Invisible, persistent, stackable
- **Effect:** Affect probability, not stats

### Correction vs. Possession
- **Correction:** Gradual, normalized, invisible (can be resisted)
- **Possession:** Direct, immediate, visible (no autonomy)
- **Escalation:** Possession is escalation from correction

### System Adaptation
- **Always:** Gradual, logical, computational (not theatrical)
- **Never:** Gets angry, acts personally, creates boss arenas
- **Method:** Changes incentives, not threats

## Timeline Reference

### Character Arrivals
- **Rowan:** Book 1, Ch 1 (present day, reference point)
- **Jordan:** 6 months before Rowan (server room incident)
- **Lio, Kellan, Tara:** Already in System world

### Book-to-Book Gaps
- **Book 1 → Book 2:** Minimal (seamless)
- **Book 2 → Book 3:** Three weeks
- **Book 3 → Book 4:** Two months
- **Book 4 → Book 5:** Minimal (seamless)
- **Book 5 → Book 6:** Six months
- **Book 6 Epilogue:** One year after reformation

## System Communication Rules

### Visible Users (Rowan, Alex)
- See floating text notifications
- See probability percentages
- See status updates

### Non-Visible Users (Lio, Kellan, Tara)
- Feel pressure, emotional weight
- Feel physical discomfort
- Feel cognitive friction
- Feel directional nudges

### Post-Reformation (Book 6)
- **System says less** (or nothing)
- Silence feels like growth
- Minimal/ambiguous messages only

---

## Character Status by Book End

### Book 1 End
- Rowan: Pattern-breaker, System isolated her
- Lio: Core companion, growing
- Kellan: Partially recovered from correction
- Cohort: Found family established

### Book 2 End
- Rowan: Empathy weaponized, identity fracture
- Lio: Grounding presence, loyal
- Kellan: **ALIGNED** (System-like, efficient)
- Tara: Protected, correction risk remains
- Cohort: Leaves city, costs follow

### Book 3 End
- Rowan: Resists normalization, builds small network
- Lio: Chose resistance over safety, stronger
- Kellan: Alignment deepens, still fighting
- Tara: Confirmed in resistance
- River: Partially recovered, chooses resistance
- Cohort: Small network, high cost

### Book 4 End
- Rowan: Network built, trust learned, betrayal survived
- Lio: Helps rebuild network, recovers from betrayal
- Kellan: Still aligned but fighting
- Tara: Network organizer, correction risk managed
- Jordan: Partial alignment struggle, technical skills
- Nova: Traumatized, recovering slowly
- Cohort: Small, tight network, preparing for journey

### Book 5 End
- Rowan: Empathy on System (costly), understands change is process
- Lio: Supports network
- Kellan: Still aligned but fighting
- Tara: Network leader
- Jordan: Alignment improves, technical contribution
- Nova: Recovering
- Cohort: System beginning to change (partial)

### Book 6 End
- Rowan: Peace (scars remain), accepts imperfection
- Lio: **Leader**, confident, helps others
- Kellan: **REDEEMED**, humanity restored, withdrawal survived
- Tara: **No longer at correction risk**, network leader
- Jordan: **Fully recovered**, **bridge between worlds**
- Nova: Functional (scars remain), healing continues
- Wildcard: **Legible** (sacrifice)
- Cohort: Found family complete, imperfect but free

## Red Flags to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do These

1. **Kellan's alignment:** Don't make it sudden or easy to reverse
2. **Empathy cost:** Don't let it disappear or become cheap
3. **System adaptation:** Don't make it convenient or theatrical
4. **Character recovery:** Don't make it complete/clean (scars remain)
5. **System messages:** Don't escalate to threats (stays polite)
6. **Reformation:** Don't make it instant or perfect

### ✅ Always Do These

1. **Kellan's alignment:** Gradual, costly, withdrawal hurts
2. **Empathy cost:** Escalates, lingers, scars remain
3. **System adaptation:** Gradual, logical, computational
4. **Character recovery:** Partial, ongoing, scars visible
5. **System messages:** Polite, bureaucratic, patient
6. **Reformation:** Slow, partial, process not event

---

## Quick Consistency Checks

### Before Writing a Scene, Ask:

1. **Is Kellan aligned?** (Books 2-5: Yes, but fighting. Book 6: Redeemed)
2. **What's Rowan's empathy cost?** (Escalates, never disappears)
3. **How does System respond?** (Gradual, logical, not angry)
4. **Are scars visible?** (Yes, always)
5. **Is reformation perfect?** (No, partial, ongoing)
6. **Does System get angry?** (No, stays computational)
