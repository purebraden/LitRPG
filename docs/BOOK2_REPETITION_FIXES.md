# Book 2 Repetition Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### ✅ Chapter 6.5 vs Chapter 7 - Fixed
**Problem:** Both used same examples (cart wheel squealing, kettle whistling, conversation ending)
**Fix:** Changed Chapter 6.5 to use different examples:
- Old: cart wheel squealing, kettle whistling, conversation ending
- New: coin dropped under stall, ball in street, sign swinging loose

**Result:** Chapters now have distinct examples while maintaining theme

---

### ✅ Chapter 12.5 vs Chapter 14 - Fixed
**Problem:** Both had nearly identical Wildcard explanations about correction vs healing
**Fix:** 
- Chapter 12.5: Shorter, more immediate explanation focused on "feeling again isn't the same as being whole"
- Chapter 14: Keeps full explanation about "waking up isn't healing"

**Result:** Chapter 12.5 focuses on immediate aftermath/guilt, Chapter 14 focuses on reflection/understanding

---

### ✅ Shelter Descriptions - Fixed
**Problem:** Multiple chapters used similar "They found shelter in [location], hidden behind [details]. Not safe. Not permanent. Just quiet."
**Fix:** Varied descriptions:
- Chapter 9.5: "storage room beneath a shop, accessible through a narrow door"
- Chapter 10: "back room of a closed shop, hidden behind empty shelves" (kept - works)
- Chapter 12.5: "space between two buildings, a narrow gap" (changed from "abandoned building")

**Result:** Each chapter has a distinct shelter description

---

### ✅ "Remembering hurts" Repetition - Fixed
**Problem:** Chapter 12.5 repeated "remembering hurts" many times
**Fix:** Varied language:
- Changed to "feeling again is pain" / "feeling again isn't the same as being whole"
- Kept "remembering hurts" in Chapter 12 (appropriate there)

**Result:** Less repetitive, more varied language
