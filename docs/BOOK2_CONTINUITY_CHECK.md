# Book 2 End-to-End Continuity Check

## Issues Found and Fixed

### ✅ FIXED: Meta Reference in Chapter 8
**Location:** Chapter 8, line 7
**Issue:** "After Chapter Seven, the city had adapted." - This is a meta reference that breaks immersion
**Fix Applied:** Changed to "After the gaps, after Wildcard's appearance, the city had adapted."

### ✅ FIXED: Repetitive Shelter Descriptions
**Location:** Chapter 9.5 and Chapter 10
**Issue:** Both chapters start with finding shelter in similar locations (storage room/back room of closed shop)
**Fix Applied:** Chapter 10 now starts with "The hours stretched" and continues in the same storage room, removing the repetitive "finding shelter" opening.

### ✅ FIXED: Chapter 12.75 to 13 Transition
**Location:** Between Chapter 12.75 and 13
**Issue:** Abrupt transition from David's room to "By afternoon"
**Fix Applied:** Added transition sentence in Chapter 13: "They'd left David's room hours ago, moving through alleys and service corridors, staying hidden."

### ✅ FIXED: Chapter 12.5 to 12.75 Transition
**Location:** Between Chapter 12.5 and 12.75
**Issue:** Abrupt transition from "space between buildings" to finding David
**Fix Applied:** Added transition in Chapter 12.75: "They moved through the city, staying in the shadows, watching for signs of the ripple's spread."

**Status:** Checking...

### ⚠️ MODERATE: Chapter 12.5 to 12.75 Transition
**Location:** Between Chapter 12.5 and 12.75

2. **Fix Chapter 9.5/10 shelter repetition** - Make Chapter 10 start in same location or clearly move
3. **Verify Chapter 12.75 to 13 transition** - Ensure timeline makes sense
4. **Add transition sentence in Chapter 12.5 to 12.75** - Make it clear they're moving to find David
