# Polish Summary - Flow and Continuity Fixes

## Changes Made

### ✅ Fixed Critical Transitions

#### 1. Chapter 14 → Chapter 15 (Aftermath → The Healing)
**Problem:** Chapter 14 ended with "They moved on" but Chapter 15 started with them already in an alcove for three days. No bridge explaining how they found the alcove or decided to stop.

**Fix:** Added bridge text at end of Chapter 14:
- Established that they found an alcove
- Explained why they stopped (Kellan's condition)
- Set up the decision to rest and heal
- Connected smoothly to Chapter 15's opening

**Lines Added:** ~15 lines at end of Chapter 14

---

#### 2. Chapter 15 → Chapter 16 (The Healing → Anomalous Persistence)
**Problem:** Transition felt abrupt - Chapter 15 ended with them starting to move, Chapter 16 immediately jumped into noticing system lag.

**Fix:** Added opening line to Chapter 16 establishing they'd been walking for hours, making the system lag observation feel more natural.

**Lines Added:** 1 line at start of Chapter 16

## Consistency Checks Performed

### ✅ Physical State (Rowan's Ankle)
- Consistently referenced throughout
- Brace mentioned when appropriate
- Pain levels match context
- No inconsistencies found

### ✅ System Behavior
- Chapter 18 establishes Rowan's isolation (VISIBILITY: RESTRICTED, INTERACTION PROTOCOL: LIMITED)
- This isolation is acknowledged by the Wildcard in Chapter 19 (who has special knowledge)
- System messages in Chapter 19 and 20 appear less frequently, matching isolation
- Behavior consistent with established rules

### ✅ Character Knowledge
- Rowan's understanding of the System builds logically
- Information revealed at appropriate times
- No early knowledge leaks
- Character arcs progress naturally

---

## Remaining Notes

### Prologue → Chapter 1
**Status:** ✅ Intentional overlap - Prologue shows "last normal moment" and fall, Chapter 1 shows immediate aftermath. Works as designed. Chapter 1 reads well standalone for readers who skip prologue.

### Chapter 21 → Epilogue  
**Status:** ✅ Intentional time jump - Epilogue shows "three days later" adaptation. Standard structure for epilogues. Works well.

## Assessment

**Overall Flow:** ✅ Good - transitions now flow smoothly

**Continuity:** ✅ Consistent - no major inconsistencies found

**Character Development:** ✅ Strong - arcs progress naturally

**Pacing:** ✅ Natural - no awkward jumps

The book is ready for final polish pass focusing on prose refinement, but structural flow issues have been resolved.
