## Issues Found & Recommendations

### 1. **COMPANIONS.MD - MAJOR UPDATE NEEDED**

**Current State:** Only contains archetypes (Believer, Broken, Opportunist, Wildcard)

**Missing Content:** Specific character details for recurring companions

**Required Additions:**

#### Lio
- **First Appearance:** Book 1, Chapter 3
- **Archetype:** The Broken (initially)
- **Key Traits:**
  - Cannot see System text (feels pressure/weight instead)
  - Non-binary (uses they/them pronouns)
  - Initially terrified, relies on Rowan
  - Grows more confident but remains vulnerable to System pressure
- **Book 1 Arc:** Goes from terrified survivor to committed companion who chooses to stay with Rowan despite the cost
- **Book 2 Status:** Continues as Rowan's companion, shows growth but remains sensitive to System pressure
- **Critical Detail:** Their inability to see System text makes them vulnerable to emotional load manipulation

#### Kellan
- **First Appearance:** Book 1, Chapter 6
- **Archetype:** The Believer → **Alignment Risk** (Book 2)
- **Key Traits:**
  - Former node member who chose to help Rowan despite social penalties
  - Can sense System presence but cannot see text
  - Strategically minded, concerned with efficiency
- **Book 1 Arc:** Helps Rowan at the node, joins her group, gets corrected in Chapter 13, partially recovers
- **Book 2 Arc:** **CRITICAL - Alignment arc** (Chapters 1-5 foreshadowing, Chapter 5 alignment choice)
  - Shows increasing alignment tendencies
  - Mirrors System language
  - Reacts too well to correction scenarios
  - Becomes strategically aligned with System thinking
  - Remains physically present but mentally shifts toward System logic
- **Critical Detail:** His strategic mind makes him vulnerable to alignment because System efficiency appeals to his nature

#### Aster
- **First Appearance:** Book 1, Chapter 10
- **Archetype:** The Opportunist (with moral boundaries)
- **Key Traits:**
  - Craftsperson who makes door tools
  - Has partial visibility (can see System interference)
  - Refuses to join Rowan initially due to debt/risk
  - Provides supplies and information
- **Status:** Appears briefly, doesn't join permanently but provides tools/info

#### Sable
- **First Appearance:** Book 1, Chapter 6
- **Archetype:** The Believer (enforced through social pressure)
- **Key Traits:**
  - Leader of the node/community
  - Enforces System rules through social control
  - Sees herself as protecting the community
  - Represents learned compliance
- **Status:** Minor recurring character, represents normalized System enforcement

#### Tara
- **First Appearance:** Book 1, Chapter 21 (end)
- **Archetype:** Resistance member (new archetype?)
- **Key Traits:**
  - Part of resistance movement
  - Helps people the System wants to "optimize out"
  - **CORRECTION RISK:** Pattern of "unsafe" reactions (talks over officials, answers sideways, reacts emotionally)
  - Foreshadowed for correction in Book 2 (Chapter 3: first incorrect reaction, Chapter 9: nearly corrected)
- **Book 2 Status:** Major character, correction risk throughout

#### Wildcard
- **First Appearance:** Book 1, Chapter 19
- **Archetype:** The Wildcard
- **Key Traits:**
  - Exists partially outside System classification
  - System cannot model them (interpretability score is NULL)
  - Moves through city without triggering NPC reactions
  - Provides information but cannot stay long (creates patterns)
- **Book 2 Status:** Appears multiple times, helps guide Rowan
- **Critical Detail:** Their absence is more noticeable than their presence

#### Nessa
- **First Appearance:** Book 1, Chapter 12
- **Status:** Minor character, marked entity used as correction bait

---

### 2. **WORLD-BUILDING DETAILS - NEEDS NEW FILE**

**Missing:** Comprehensive world-building document

**Should Include:**
- The City (Book 2 setting)
  - Terraced levels
  - Population center where System is normalized
  - Subtle enforcement through social pressure
  - Governance through rules and incentives
- The Dungeon/Path System (Book 1)
  - Stairs that don't end
  - Doors as permissions
  - Nodes and sanctums
  - Anomalous zones/dead patches
- Dead Patches / Anomalous Zones
  - Places where System influence is reduced
  - Can be created or found
  - Reduce System control and pressure
- Social Enforcement
  - Reputation system
  - Community-based access control
  - Self-policing through fear

---

### 3. **SYSTEM.MD - MINOR ADDITION NEEDED**

**Current State:** Accurate but brief

**Recommended Addition:**
- System adaptation mechanisms
- How System learns from Rowan's resistance
- Difference between correction and possession
- System isolation of anomalies (sandboxing)

---

### 4. **BOOK2-MECHANICS.MD - VERIFICATION**

**Status:** ✅ Comprehensive and accurate

**Verified Against Book 2:**
- ✅ Empathy/Perspective Sync mechanics match
- ✅ Residual Permissions mechanics match
- ✅ Wildcard illegibility mechanics match
- ✅ Corrected People mechanics match
- ✅ Kellan alignment arc matches
- ✅ Tara correction risk matches

**No updates needed.**

- Tara's correction risk pattern is well-documented in book2-mechanics.md but not in companions.md
- Wildcard mechanics are well-documented in book2-mechanics.md
