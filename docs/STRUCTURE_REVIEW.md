## Recommended Priority Order

1. **HIGH PRIORITY: Expand Chapter 13** (Kellan's correction - emotional core)
2. **HIGH PRIORITY: Expand Chapter 15** (Anomaly discovery - world-building)
3. **HIGH PRIORITY: Expand Chapter 19** (Commitment scene - character development)
4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Add chapter between 14-15** (Recovery/healing focus)
5. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Expand Chapter 16** (Pattern breaking)
6. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Expand Chapter 18** (Wildcard conversation)
7. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Expand Chapter 14** (Aftermath)
8. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Expand Chapter 7** (System testing)
9. **LOW PRIORITY: Add chapter between 7-8** (Debt mechanics)
10. **LOW PRIORITY: Expand chapters 4, 9, 10, 11** (Minor expansions)

## Content Gaps Identified

1. **Missing: More System mechanics exploration** - Could add chapters showing debt, corrections, etc.
2. **Missing: More survivor encounters** - Only a few groups shown, could show more variety
3. **Missing: Recovery/healing time** - Kellan's recovery happens off-screen
4. **Missing: More dead patch exploration** - The anomaly area is underutilized
5. **Missing: More character backstory moments** - Could add flashbacks or conversations
6. **Missing: More action sequences** - Could add more creature encounters or challenges

## Recommendations

### Best Approach: Hybrid
1. Expand the shortest chapters first (quick wins)
2. Add 2-3 strategic new chapters in ACT III (where it's shortest)
3. Polish and deepen existing content
4. This should get us to ~55,000-60,000 words comfortably

### Would You Like To:
1. Start with expanding the shortest chapters?
2. Add new strategic chapters first?
3. Do a combination approach?
