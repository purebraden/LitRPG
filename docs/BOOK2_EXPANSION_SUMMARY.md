## Next Steps

### Option 1: Expand Existing Chapters (Recommended First)
1. Expand Chapter 11 (Emergency Override) - highest priority
2. Expand Chapter 10 (You Cannot Optimize Trust)
3. Expand Chapter 8 (Proxy Authority)
4. Expand Chapter 7 (Privilege Escalation)
5. Expand Chapter 14 (Exit Conditions)

**Estimated addition: ~3,800-5,100 words**
**New total after expansion: ~32,674-33,974 words**

### Option 2: Add More New Chapters
- Consider adding 1-2 more chapters if needed
- Focus on character development moments
- Explore System mechanics in more depth

### Option 3: Accept Shorter Length
- 30,000-35,000 words is still a viable novella length
- Market accordingly
- Focus on tight pacing over length

## Recommendations

1. **First:** Expand the existing chapters identified in the plan
2. **Then:** Reassess word count and determine if more chapters are needed
3. **Consider:** The book may work well at 35,000-40,000 words if pacing is tight

The three new chapters add important character development and mechanics exploration. They fit naturally into the structure and enhance the narrative flow.
