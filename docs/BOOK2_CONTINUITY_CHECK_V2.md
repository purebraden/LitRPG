# Book 2 Continuity Check V2 - Complete Review

## Issues Found and Fixed

### ✅ FIXED: Meta References (3 instances)
1. **Chapter 5, line 105:** "earlier chapters of the city" → "their time in the city"
2. **Chapter 8, line 137:** "the chapter before" → "when she'd used empathy deliberately, when she'd violated containment"
3. **Chapter 10, line 95:** "The aftermath of Chapter 9" → "The aftermath of the containment, the marking, the case-building"

### ✅ FIXED: Location Inconsistency
**Chapter 12.5:** Changed "door" and "crack in the boards" to "edge of the gap" and "narrow opening between buildings" to match the location description (space between buildings, not a room).
