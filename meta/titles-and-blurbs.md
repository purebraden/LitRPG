# Titles and Marketing Copy

## Series Title (Recommended)

**Fracture Protocol**

### Why this works:
- Feels technical, not fantasy-tropey
- Signals system failure, not power fantasy
- Scales cleanly across multiple books
- Fits Rowan's SRE mindset and the System-as-antagonist framing

### Alternate Options:
- Correction Engine
- Deviation Threshold
- Persistent Instability

**Recommendation:** Fracture Protocol is the strongest brand.

## Book 1 Title

**Fracture Protocol: Path of Unintended Consequence**

- Keeps existing working title (which is excellent)
- Sounds LitRPG without stat-bloat vibes
- Clearly signals cause → effect → cost

### Shorter KU-friendly alternative (if needed later):
- Fracture Protocol: Unintended Consequences

## Series Blurb (Series Page / Amazon Series Description)

The System promised order.
It did not promise mercy.

When reality itself is governed by a directive-driven System that optimizes outcomes over lives, survival becomes a matter of compliance.

Most people adapt.
Some break.
A rare few persist.

Fracture Protocol follows Rowan Mercer, a software engineer dragged into a world where probability, reputation, and correction dictate every choice. The System is polite. Bureaucratic. Certain it is right.

Rowan is not.

As she survives, resists, and learns to exploit the System's blind spots, Rowan discovers a dangerous truth: the System is not omnipotent — it is predictive. And prediction fails when people refuse to behave.

This is a LitRPG series about systems that optimize past empathy, resistance that carries real cost, and found family forged under pressure. Power is not free. Defiance is never clean.

And the System is always watching.

## Back Cover Copy (Book 1)

Rowan Mercer was not chosen.
She was not summoned.
She fell.

Dropped into a hostile world governed by an all-encompassing System, Rowan survives her arrival without guidance, without power, and without explanation. The System arrives late — polite, clinical, and already behind.

In this world, Paths do not grant destiny. They impose probability.

As Rowan learns to navigate incomplete data, delayed feedback, and invisible costs, she realizes the System isn't broken — it's working as designed. Compliance brings safety. Resistance brings correction.

And correction is never free.

When Rowan chooses people over optimization, the System responds. Social pressure. Escalating penalties. Quiet, efficient harm.

But Rowan has spent her life breaking systems that claimed inevitability.

And when the System hesitates — even once — she knows she's found its flaw.

Fracture Protocol: Path of Unintended Consequence is a sharp, character-driven LitRPG about hostile systems, unintended consequences, and the cost of remaining human when compliance is easier.
