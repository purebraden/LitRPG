## Pricing Strategy: Kindle vs Kindle Unlimited

### Understanding the Two Revenue Streams

#### Regular Kindle Sales (Non-KU readers)
- **How it works**: Reader buys your book for the set price
- **Your earnings**: 70% of sale price (minus delivery costs for books over 10MB)
- **Price range for 70%**: $2.99 - $9.99
- **Delivery costs**: ~$0.15 per MB for books over 10MB
- **Example**: Book priced at $4.99 = ~$3.49 per sale (70%)

#### Kindle Unlimited (KU subscribers)
- **How it works**: KU subscribers can read your book "for free" (they pay subscription)
- **Your earnings**: Paid per page read (Kindle Edition Normalized Page Count - KENPC)
- **Current rate**: ~$0.004-$0.005 per page (varies monthly based on KDP Select Global Fund)
- **Example**: 40,000 word book = ~160 pages KENPC = ~$0.64-$0.80 per full read

### Pricing Strategy for LitRPG Book 1

#### Recommended Price: **$4.99**

**Why $4.99?**
1. **70% royalty eligible**: Earns ~$3.49 per sale
2. **Market standard**: LitRPG Book 1s typically $3.99-$5.99
3. **Impulse buy range**: Low enough for discovery, high enough for quality signal
4. **Series positioning**: Signals this is a real book, not a quick cash grab

**Alternatives**:
- **$3.99**: More competitive, ~$2.79 per sale, good for aggressive marketing
- **$5.99**: Premium positioning, ~$4.19 per sale, if you have strong branding

**Avoid**:
- **$0.99**: Only 35% royalty (~$0.35 per sale), signals "low quality" to many readers
- **$2.99**: Minimum for 70% but can signal "cheap" to LitRPG market
- **$9.99+**: Too high for Book 1, 35% royalty, poor conversion

### KU vs Sales: What Matters More?

**For LitRPG Series (Your Strategy):**

**KU usually wins** because:
- LitRPG readers heavily subscribe to KU
- Series benefit from read-through (readers read Book 1-3+ in a row)
- Page reads can exceed sales revenue
- Better for rapid release (readers binge the series)

**Example Math** (simplified):
- **Sale at $4.99**: ~$3.49 one-time
- **KU full read**: ~$0.64-$0.80 one-time
- **BUT**: If 1 reader reads Books 1-3 via KU = $1.92-$2.40 total
- **AND**: KU readers are more likely to read multiple books in series
- **Result**: KU often generates more revenue for series authors

**Strategy**: 
- Price for sales ($4.99) to maximize per-sale revenue
- But optimize for KU read-through (series consistency, rapid release)

### Pricing for Future Books in Series

**Book 2-3**: **$4.99** (same as Book 1)
- Maintains consistency
- Signals equal value

**Book 4+**: Consider **$5.99**
- By this point, you have engaged readers
- Can command slightly higher price
- Still 70% royalty eligible

**Box Sets**: Consider later
- Books 1-3 bundle at $9.99 or $12.99
- Attracts new readers
- Additional revenue stream
