**Example structure for "Fracture Protocol: Path of Unintended Consequence":**
```
[Hook paragraph - Rowan's situation and stakes]

[Series hook - Book 1 of Fracture Protocol series]
```

#### 4. Research Keywords

- **Examples for your book**:
  - LitRPG
  - Isekai
  - Female protagonist
  - System apocalypse
  - Dungeon crawler
  - Found family
  - Sci-fi fantasy

**Tip**: Use KDP's keyword research tool or browse Amazon bestsellers in your genre.

#### 5. Choose Categories
- **Primary Category**: Pick the most specific one (e.g., "Science Fiction & Fantasy > Fantasy > Contemporary")
- **Secondary Category**: Second best fit
- **Additional Categories**: Amazon may add more based on keywords and sales
- **For LitRPG**: Usually "Science Fiction & Fantasy > Fantasy" + "Science Fiction & Fantasy > Science Fiction"

## Pricing Strategy: Kindle vs Kindle Unlimited

### Understanding the Two Revenue Streams

#### Regular Kindle Sales (Non-KU readers)
- **How it works**: Reader buys your book for the set price
- **Your earnings**: 70% of sale price (minus delivery costs for books over 10MB)
- **Price range for 70%**: $2.99 - $9.99
- **Delivery costs**: ~$0.15 per MB for books over 10MB
- **Example**: Book priced at $4.99 = ~$3.49 per sale (70%)

#### Kindle Unlimited (KU subscribers)
- **How it works**: KU subscribers can read your book "for free" (they pay subscription)
- **Your earnings**: Paid per page read (Kindle Edition Normalized Page Count - KENPC)
- **Current rate**: ~$0.004-$0.005 per page (varies monthly based on KDP Select Global Fund)
- **Example**: 40,000 word book = ~160 pages KENPC = ~$0.64-$0.80 per full read

### Pricing Strategy for LitRPG Book 1

#### Recommended Price: **$4.99**

**Why $4.99?**
1. **70% royalty eligible**: Earns ~$3.49 per sale
2. **Market standard**: LitRPG Book 1s typically $3.99-$5.99
3. **Impulse buy range**: Low enough for discovery, high enough for quality signal
4. **Series positioning**: Signals this is a real book, not a quick cash grab

**Alternatives**:
- **$3.99**: More competitive, ~$2.79 per sale, good for aggressive marketing
- **$5.99**: Premium positioning, ~$4.19 per sale, if you have strong branding

**Avoid**:
- **$0.99**: Only 35% royalty (~$0.35 per sale), signals "low quality" to many readers
- **$2.99**: Minimum for 70% but can signal "cheap" to LitRPG market
- **$9.99+**: Too high for Book 1, 35% royalty, poor conversion

### KU vs Sales: What Matters More?

**For LitRPG Series (Your Strategy):**

**KU usually wins** because:
- LitRPG readers heavily subscribe to KU
- Series benefit from read-through (readers read Book 1-3+ in a row)
- Page reads can exceed sales revenue
- Better for rapid release (readers binge the series)

**Example Math** (simplified):
- **Sale at $4.99**: ~$3.49 one-time
- **KU full read**: ~$0.64-$0.80 one-time
- **BUT**: If 1 reader reads Books 1-3 via KU = $1.92-$2.40 total
- **AND**: KU readers are more likely to read multiple books in series
- **Result**: KU often generates more revenue for series authors

**Strategy**: 
- Price for sales ($4.99) to maximize per-sale revenue
- But optimize for KU read-through (series consistency, rapid release)

### Pricing for Future Books in Series

**Book 2-3**: **$4.99** (same as Book 1)
- Maintains consistency
- Signals equal value

**Book 4+**: Consider **$5.99**
- By this point, you have engaged readers
- Can command slightly higher price
- Still 70% royalty eligible

**Box Sets**: Consider later
- Books 1-3 bundle at $9.99 or $12.99
- Attracts new readers
- Additional revenue stream

   - [ ] **Resolution**: At least 1000px on longest side (but not too large - see below)
   - [ ] **Color space**: RGB (not CMYK - this can cause issues!)
   - [ ] **No transparency**: Some modules don't support PNG transparency - convert to JPG if needed
   - Try re-uploading any images that seem problematic
   - Try converting images to JPG format if they're PNG and causing issues

4. **Module Structure:**
   - [ ] You have at least 1 module added
   - [ ] No modules are completely empty
   - [ ] Try deleting and re-adding any problematic modules

**Step-by-Step Debug Process:**

1. **Start Fresh (if needed):**
   - Delete all modules
   - Add modules one at a time
   - Save after each module is complete
   - This helps identify which module is causing the problem

2. **Simplified Test:**
   - Create just ONE module first (Standard Image Header with Text)
   - Fill in: Image + Headline + Body text (under 500 chars)
   - Try to save
   - If this works, add modules one by one

3. **Common Save-Blocking Issues:**
   - Sidebar left empty in "Standard Single Image and Sidebar" modules
   - Image upload failed but module thinks image is required
   - Text field has invisible/invalid characters
   - Module type mismatch (wrong template selected)

**⚠️ BEFORE PREVIEWING - Common Issues That Cause "Project could not be deserialized" Error:**

If you get error **"Failed to preview content - Error: HttpRequestError: Requested from: [/aplus/api/PreviewContent]. Received status: [400] with message: [Project could not be deserialized (CatchAll)]"**, check these:

1. **"Standard Single Image and Sidebar" modules REQUIRE sidebar content:**
   - The sidebar section cannot be empty
   - You must fill in EITHER sidebar text (headline + body) OR upload a sidebar image
   - If using text sidebar: Both "Sidebar Headline" and "Sidebar Text" fields must have content
   - This is the #1 cause of this error!

2. **Text length limits:**
   - Body text: Maximum 500 characters per module
   - Headlines: Keep under 100 characters
   - Count characters carefully (including spaces and line breaks)

3. **Image requirements:**
   - All images must be uploaded and processed successfully
   - Format: JPEG or PNG only
   - File size: Under 5MB recommended
   - Resolution: At least 1000px wide for main images
   - No corrupted files or upload errors

4. **Required fields:**
   - Every module MUST have a headline
   - Every module MUST have body text OR an image (depending on module type)
   - Sidebar modules MUST have sidebar content (text or image)

5. **Invalid characters:**
   - Avoid special HTML characters that might break parsing
   - Avoid emojis in some contexts (they can cause issues)
   - Keep formatting simple (plain text, no HTML tags)

**Quick Fix Checklist:**
- [ ] Every "Standard Single Image and Sidebar" module has sidebar content filled in
- [ ] All body text is under 500 characters
- [ ] All images uploaded successfully with no errors
- [ ] Every module has both headline and body text
- [ ] No empty required fields

**If error persists:**
1. Try saving your content first (click "Save" button), then preview
2. Clear browser cache and try again
3. Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
4. Remove and re-add the problematic module
5. **If images are the problem:** See "Image Troubleshooting" section below
6. Contact KDP Support with your Project ID if still not working

### Image Troubleshooting Guide

**If images are preventing you from saving, check these issues:**

**1. Color Space (Most Common Issue!):**
- **Problem**: Images in CMYK color space will fail
- **Fix**: Convert to RGB
  - Photoshop: Image → Mode → RGB Color
  - GIMP: Image → Mode → RGB
  - Online: Use cloudconvert.com or similar tool
- **Check**: Open image in a viewer, check properties/details - must say "RGB"

**2. File Size:**
- **Problem**: Files over 5MB will be rejected
- **Fix**: Compress images before uploading
  - Use online tools like TinyPNG.com or Squoosh.app
  - Or in Photoshop: Save for Web → JPG quality 80-90%
- **Target**: Under 2MB per image for best results

**3. Dimensions:**
- **Problem**: Too large (over 5000px) or too small (under 1000px) can fail
- **Fix**: Resize images
  - Minimum: 1000px on longest side
  - Maximum: 3000px recommended (5000px absolute max)
  - Use Photoshop, GIMP, or online resizers

**4. PNG Transparency:**
- **Problem**: PNG files with transparency can cause issues in some modules
- **Fix**: Convert PNG to JPG
  - Add a background color first (white or color that matches design)
  - Then save as JPG
  - Or use modules that support PNG transparency

**5. Corrupted Files:**
- **Problem**: File corruption during export
- **Fix**: Re-export from original source
  - Don't edit already-corrupted files
  - Start from original image file
  - Export fresh copy

**6. Wrong Format:**
- **Problem**: File extension doesn't match actual format
- **Fix**: Open and re-save in correct format
  - Make sure .jpg files are actually JPEG
  - Make sure .png files are actually PNG
  - Don't just rename file extensions

**Quick Fix Workflow:**
1. Remove all images from your modules temporarily
2. Try saving (if this works, images are definitely the problem)
3. Process one image at a time:
   - Convert to RGB if needed
   - Resize to 2000px max width/height
   - Compress to under 2MB
   - Convert PNG to JPG if transparency issues
4. Re-upload images one by one, saving after each
5. When one fails, that's your problematic image

**Image Requirements:**
- **Format**: JPEG or PNG (JPG often more reliable than PNG)
- **Resolution**: 
  - Minimum: 1000px on longest side
  - Recommended: 1500-2500px on longest side
  - Maximum: Don't go too large (over 5000px can cause issues)
- **File Size**: 
  - Under 5MB per image (Amazon requirement)
  - Under 2MB recommended for faster upload/processing
  - If images are too large, compress them before uploading
- **Color Space**: RGB (NOT CMYK - CMYK images will fail!)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 
  - Banners/headers: 3:1 to 4:1 ratio works well
  - Square images: Work for quadrants or sidebars
  - Avoid extreme aspect ratios (very wide or tall)
- **Transparency**: 
  - PNG transparency may cause issues in some modules
  - If PNG with transparency fails, convert to JPG with background color
- **No Watermarks**: Images must be watermark-free
- **Content**: Must be appropriate and related to your book

**Common Image Problems That Prevent Saving:**
1. **CMYK color space** (convert to RGB in Photoshop/GIMP/etc.)
2. **File too large** (over 5MB - compress it)
3. **Dimensions too extreme** (over 5000px or under 1000px)
4. **Corrupted file** (re-export from original source)
5. **PNG transparency issues** (convert to JPG)
6. **Wrong file extension** (make sure .jpg files are actually JPEG format)

**Text Requirements:**
- **Body Text**: Maximum 500 characters per module
- **No HTML**: Plain text only (no formatting tags)
- **Professional Tone**: Keep it polished and error-free

### Best Practices for LitRPG Books

1. **Lead with Genre**: Make it clear this is LitRPG/Isekai early
2. **Highlight Unique Elements**: Emphasize what makes your book different (System as antagonist, SRE perspective)
3. **Show Character Depth**: Not just stats and powers, but relationships and consequences
4. **Series Hook**: Make sure readers know this is part of a series (builds commitment)
5. **Visual Appeal**: Use your banner images to create visual breaks and interest

### Quick Checklist Before Submitting

- [ ] All text is proofread (no typos)
- [ ] Images are high-quality and display correctly

- [ ] ASIN is correct
- [ ] Preview looks good on desktop and mobile

### After Approval

- A+ Content appears in the **"From the Publisher"** section on your book's product page

### Pro Tips

1. **Test Different Versions**: After a few months, you can try different A+ Content to see what converts better
2. **Series Consistency**: Use similar module structure for Book 2, 3, etc. to create brand consistency
3. **Mobile Preview**: Always check mobile preview—many readers shop on phones
