# Book 2 Appendix — Corrected State & System Possession

## Definition: Corrected State
A **Corrected** person is a formerly autonomous individual whose decision-making has been repeatedly overridden by the System.

Correction is not death.
Correction is not mind control.
Correction is **procedural occupation**.

The System does not erase the person — it reduces them to a compliant surface.

## Observable Symptoms

### Behavioral
- Delayed reactions (speech precedes intent or follows it)
- Repeated phrasing across unrelated NPCs
- Overly calm responses to danger or injustice
- Inability to initiate new goals

### Physical
- Movements snap into place after brief hesitation
- Eyes track independently from head movement
- Posture resets after interruption

### Emotional
- Affect appears appropriate but arrives late
- Empathy contact produces *absence*, not resistance
- Emotional response may occur **after** System control releases

---

## System Capabilities via Corrected Individuals

The System can:
- Route dialogue through corrected people
- Borrow bodies temporarily for enforcement or messaging
- Stabilize narrative outcomes using corrected crowds
- Apply social pressure without open violence

The System avoids:
- Sustained possession (high cost)
- Complex emotional exchanges
- Situations requiring improvisation

---

## Interaction with Empathy (Perspective Sync)

Empathy does **not** override correction.

Instead, it:
- Reveals what the person experienced while controlled
- Causes pain, grief, or confusion
- Can destabilize nearby corrected individuals
- Leaves residual emotional fragments

Repeated empathy use risks:
- Psychological harm to the corrected person
- Escalated System intervention
- Faster conversion from correction → possession

---

## Recovery States

Correction is reversible only if:
- The System disengages voluntarily or is disrupted
- The person retains residual emotional continuity
- Trust-based relationships remain intact

Recovery is:
- Slow
- Incomplete
- Traumatic

Some never recover.

---

## Narrative Rules (Hard Constraints)

- Corrected people are never disposable enemies
- Possession always escalates System cost
- Empathy must have aftermath beyond the scene
- Healing is harder than correction
- Rowan cannot "save" everyone

---

## Thematic Purpose

Corrected people embody:
- The cost of optimization
- The violence of enforced normalcy
- The danger of frictionless systems

They are not monsters.
They are warnings.
