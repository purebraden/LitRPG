# Book 1 Outline  
## *Path of Unintended Consequence* (Working Title)

### Core Promise of Book 1
Rowan Mercer survives long enough to realize the System is not benevolent, not neutral, and not infallible—and that resisting it is possible, but never free.

---

## ACT I — Dislocation & Survival (Chapters 1–4)

### Chapter 1 — The Failure Event
*(Written)*

- Rowan is isekai’d via an unceremonious fall  
- Survives without System assistance  
- Kills a creature through raw desperation  
- System appears late  
- Establishes System incompetence and threat  

**Purpose:**  
Hook, tone, voice, credibility

---

### Chapter 2 — Path Assignment
- Rowan wakes with injuries partially stabilized  
- System assigns her first Path (vague, outcome-based)  
- No tutorial, no class, no clear rewards  
- Notices missing data and implied costs  
- Accepts conditionally because refusal appears worse  

**Key System Behavior:**
- Polite  
- Bureaucratic  
- Avoids answering “why”  

---

### Chapter 3 — Undocumented Mechanics
- Rowan tests the System’s limits  
- Notices delayed feedback and probability drift  
- Discovers Path influence nudges behavior rather than controls it  
- First hint that resistance accumulates invisible debt  

**Purpose:**  
Teach rules without exposition

---

### Chapter 4 — The First Choice
- Rowan encounters another living person  
- Optimal choice would abandon them  
- She intervenes anyway  
- System flags **Deviation Detected**  

**End Beat:**  
Rowan realizes the System watches decisions, not outcomes

---

## ACT II — Adaptation & Alliance (Chapters 5–11)

### Chapter 5 — Companion Zero
- Stabilizes injured survivor  
- Gains first true companion (Broken or Believer)  
- Learns world has accepted the System  
- Rowan reveals deep systems thinking  

**Purpose:**  
Establish found-family seed

---

### Chapter 6 — Social Penalties
- First non-lethal correction  
- Reputation damage  
- NPC hostility  
- Resource access restricted  
- Companion says this is “normal”  

Rowan disagrees.

---

### Chapter 7 — Monitoring the World
- Rowan deliberately runs “tests”  
- Repeats actions with variations  
- Learns magic has failure modes  
- Discovers the System does not correct everything  

**Key Insight:**  
The System prioritizes trend correction, not precision

---

### Chapter 8 — The Cost of Optimization
- Encounters perfectly compliant group  
- Efficient, successful… hollow  
- Someone is sacrificed “for the greater outcome”  

**Emotional turning point**

---

### Chapter 9 — Second Companion
- Rowan intervenes again, inefficiently  
- Gains Opportunist or Wildcard  
- System influence spikes  
- Pressure increases  

**End Beat:**  
System warning with no stated punishment

---

### Chapter 10 — System Debt
- Learns accumulated deviation worsens corrections  
- Companion explains escalation  
- Rowan recognizes technical debt—but with people  

She continues anyway.

---

### Chapter 11 — Choosing the Team
- Rowan commits to protecting companions  
- Accepts loss of power  
- System probabilities downgrade  

**Quiet Core Moment:**  
People over optimization

---

## ACT III — Correction & Consequence (Chapters 12–17)

### Chapter 12 — Forced Efficiency
- System engineers single “viable” outcome  
- Rowan attempts to break it  
- Fails  

**Purpose:**  
Show System teeth

---

### Chapter 13 — The Price
- Companion seriously harmed (not killed)  
- Rowan blamed socially and internally  
- System frames loss as avoidable  
- Burnout trauma triggered  

---

### Chapter 14 — Aftermath
- Rowan spirals briefly  
- Considers compliance  
- Companions choose her  

Found family solidifies.

---

### Chapter 15 — Anomalous Persistence
- System behaves differently around Rowan  
- Messages arrive late  
- Corrections hesitate  
- Others cannot see what she sees  

This is new.

---

### Chapter 16 — Breaking Pattern
- Rowan creates an edge case  
- Forces System into two bad outcomes  
- System hesitates  

**Major Revelation:**  
The System can stall

---

### Chapter 17 — Private Update
- Rowan receives private Path update  

```
Status: Persistent Instability Detected
Correction Model: Under Review
```

The System is adapting to her.

---

## ACT IV — Recognition (Chapters 18–20)

### Chapter 18 — The Wildcard Speaks
- Partial truth revealed  
- Rowan not first anomaly  
- First to persist  
- System used to be different  

---

### Chapter 19 — Commitment
- Rowan accepts true cost of resistance  
- Commits anyway  
- Moves toward known correction zone  

**Purpose:**  
Agency

---

### Chapter 20 — End of Book Hook
- Rowan enters new region / dungeon / city  
- System issues chilling update  

```
Path Status: Active
Deviation Tolerance: Reduced
Corrective Influence: Escalated
```

Rowan thinks:  
*Then I’ll need to be very careful who I protect next.*

---

## Why This Outline Works
- Clear progression without stat bloat  
- Strong emotional arc  
- System as antagonist  
- Found family foundation  
- Natural sequel hook  
- KU binge-friendly pacing  

Book 2 escalates scope instead of re-explaining mechanics.
