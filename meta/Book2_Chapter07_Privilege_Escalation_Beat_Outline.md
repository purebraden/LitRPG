# Book 2 — Chapter 7: Privilege Escalation  
## Tight Beat Outline (Cursor Draft Reference)

---

## Chapter Purpose
Rowan deliberately recreates a violation.  
Wildcard re-enters on-page.  
The System escalates from monitoring to containment.

**Core Question:** What happens when resistance stops being accidental?

---

## ACT I — SIGNALS IN THE NOISE (≈400–500 words)

### Beat 1: Environmental Wrongness
- Probability gaps feel patterned, not random  
- Dropped object not retrieved  
- Conversation ends without closure  
- Corrected person pauses too long before resuming  
- This is avoidance, not correction failure

**Tone:** Unease without explanation

---

### Beat 2: Lio Identifies Absence
- Lio notices something isn’t reacting  
- “They didn’t route around something.”  
- Kellan dismisses it as coincidence  
- Tara feels watched but can’t name why

**Purpose:** Lio remains the grounding observer

---

### Beat 3: Wildcard’s Fingerprints
- Rowan recognizes gaps from Book 1  
- NPCs behave as if something isn’t there  
- Corrected person ignores a trigger moment

**Note:** No Wildcard yet — only negative space

---

## ACT II — THE MEETING WITHOUT OBSERVERS (≈600–700 words)

### Beat 4: Wildcard Appears
- Wildcard enters mid-action  
- No introduction  
- No reaction from corrected people  
- Normal NPCs hesitate, then move on

**Rule:** Do not describe Wildcard physically — define by reaction

---

### Beat 5: The Contrast
- Wildcard explains their method plainly  
  - No consistency  
  - No optimization  
  - No repeatable success  
- They point out Rowan’s flaw:
  - Empathy creates data  
  - Understanding leaves traces

**Effect:** Rowan unsettled

---

### Beat 6: System Blind Spot Demonstration
- Wildcard passes through:
  - Checkpoint  
  - Corrected cluster  
  - Stabilized zone  
- No response  
- Rowan senses System confusion, not empathy

---

### Beat 7: Warning
- Wildcard: “If you do it on purpose, they’ll notice.”  
- Names Rowan as a repeatable anomaly  
- Refuses further help unless Rowan chooses knowingly

---

## ACT III — DELIBERATE VIOLATION (≈600–700 words)

### Beat 8: Rowan Chooses
- Rowan decides to recreate a residual permission  
- Does not optimize  
- Accepts cost in advance

**Moral Pivot**

---

### Beat 9: Controlled Empathy Trigger
- Semi-public space  
- Corrected person: stable, smiling, functional  
- Empathy echoes sideways, not deeper  
- Residual permissions interact unpredictably

---

### Beat 10: System Response
- City reacts faster and more coordinated  
- Less human-facing  
- Possession flickers but does not land  
- Observers reposition

**This is containment**

---

### Beat 11: Wildcard Withdraws
- Wildcard vanishes before escalation completes  
- No farewell  
- Absence breaks a correction chain

---

## ACT IV — CONSEQUENCES WITHOUT CLOSURE (≈300–400 words)

### Beat 12: Aftermath
- Longer aftermath  
- Sharper emotional bleed  
- Kellan distances himself  
- Tara flagged again

---

### Beat 13: System Adaptation Confirmed
- Rowan glimpses:
  - Interpretability increasing  
  - Tolerance decreasing  
- Realizes she taught the System something

**Emotion:** Regret, not guilt

---

## FINAL BEAT — TITLE LOCK
- Rowan understands “Privilege Escalation”:
  - Accessed something she can’t unlearn  
  - System now assumes intent  
- End on inevitability, not threat

---

## Drafting Checklist
- [ ] Wildcard never explains *how*, only *why*  
- [ ] Rowan chooses violation consciously  
- [ ] Empathy is never clean or victorious  
- [ ] System escalates structurally, not emotionally  
- [ ] No scene resolves neatly
