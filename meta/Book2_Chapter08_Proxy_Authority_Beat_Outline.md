# Book 2 — Chapter 8: Proxy Authority  
## Tight Beat Outline (Cursor Draft Reference)

---

## Chapter Purpose

The System speaks **indirectly** for the first time.  
Possession is no longer theoretical.  
Rowan learns the System does not argue — it **routes authority through people**.

**Core Question:** What does the System sound like when it tries to explain itself?

---

## STRUCTURAL OVERVIEW

- This is **not** a confrontation chapter  
- This is a **demonstration**  
- Horror comes from *procedural calm*, not threat  

---

## ACT I — AFTERSHOCKS (≈350–450 words)

### Beat 1: Environmental Coldness
- City feels subtly different after Chapter 7:
  - Less variance
  - Fewer gaps
  - More anticipatory correction
- Fewer mistakes because outcomes are preempted

**Tone:** Controlled, sterile, emotionally distant

---

### Beat 2: Rowan’s Aftermath
- Empathy backlash lingers longer
- Emotional bleed feels flattened, not intense
- Loss of urgency becomes the danger

---

### Beat 3: Kellan’s Behavioral Shift
- Calm, efficient, helpful
- Finishes sentences
- Uses System-aligned language unconsciously
- Frames problems as resolution, not choice

---

## ACT II — THE PROXY (≈600–700 words)

### Beat 4: First Contact (Indirect)
- Corrected person approaches Rowan
- Polite, procedural, calm
- Speaks *to* Rowan but not **as themselves**

---

### Beat 5: Language Shift
- Passive constructions
- Conditional phrasing
- Incomplete cause → effect chains
- Avoids “I” and “want”
- Uses “process,” “stability,” “efficiency”

---

### Beat 6: Empathy Attempt (Fails Differently)
- Rowan tries empathy reflexively
- Hits layered state behind the person
- Receives **approval**, not emotion

---

### Beat 7: System Classification Leak
- System acknowledges empathy
- Cannot classify it
- Labels it contamination / overlap / corruption
- Speech pauses, loops, restarts

---

## ACT III — DEMONSTRATION OF CONTROL (≈500–600 words)

### Beat 8: Authority Routing
- Proxy redirects traffic
- Pauses a public process
- Triggers correction elsewhere
- No force, socially normalized

---

### Beat 9: Tara Is Targeted (Soft)
- Tara speaks out of turn
- Conversation routes around her
- Temporary social invisibility

---

### Beat 10: Wildcard Absence
- System references something that fails
- Proxy speech degrades briefly
- Correction chain breaks, then reroutes

---

## ACT IV — SYSTEM STATEMENT (≈300–400 words)

### Beat 11: Boundary Declaration
- Empathy monitored
- Repetition interpreted as intent
- Stability prioritized over variance
- No threat, only policy

---

### Beat 12: Aftermath & Realization
- System is containing and learning
- Empathy accelerates adaptation
- Conflict becomes asymmetric

---

## FINAL BEAT — TITLE LOCK

**Proxy Authority:**  
The System does not need a body.  
It does not need permission.  
It speaks through compliance.

---

## Drafting Checklist

- [ ] Proxy remains human on surface  
- [ ] Bureaucratic, procedural language
