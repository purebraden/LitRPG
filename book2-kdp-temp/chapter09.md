# Chapter 9: Privilege Escalation

Rowan noticed the gaps first.

Not the obvious ones—the kind you could point at and say something was wrong. These were smaller, quieter failures—moments that didn't complete.

A crate tipped at the edge of a loading platform and stayed there, balanced impossibly on one corner. No one rushed to steady it. No one cursed. People walked around it as if the interruption had already been accounted for.

A conversation near a bakery ended mid-sentence. The two speakers nodded, satisfied, and turned away without the usual social stitching—no farewell, no shared understanding of closure.

A corrected woman paused in the street, her foot hovering a breath too long above the stone. Then she stepped forward and continued, smile intact.

Avoidance.

Not correction failure or error. Something was being routed around.

Lio slowed beside her. “Do you feel that?”

Rowan nodded. “It’s like the city keeps expecting something to happen. And then… it doesn’t.”

Kellan glanced back at them, frowning. “You’re reading into noise.”

“I don’t think so,” Lio said. He pointed ahead, where foot traffic curved subtly around an empty patch of street. “They didn’t route around an obstacle. They routed around nothing.”

Tara hugged her arms to her sides. “I hate this place,” she muttered. “It’s like being watched by something that won’t admit it’s looking.”

Rowan’s pulse quickened. The gaps tugged at memory—echoes of moments from before the city, before alignment and correction had names.

Negative space.

They turned a corner, and someone stepped into the flow of the street as if they’d always been there.

No one reacted.

The crowd bent, adjusted, continued. A corrected man passed within inches of the newcomer and did not so much as glance sideways. His eyes tracked storefronts, schedules, invisible priorities.

Wildcard stood in the open, unremarkable and undefined.

Rowan felt the pressure immediately—not empathy, not pain. Confusion. The System brushing past something it could not index.

“Hi,” Wildcard said, casual as a greeting between strangers.

“You’re not supposed to be here,” Kellan said automatically.

Wildcard smiled faintly. “That’s the idea.”

They walked together, or rather, Rowan and the others walked and Wildcard occupied space beside them that never quite registered. Normal people hesitated when their paths intersected, then chose some other micro-adjustment. Corrected people did nothing at all.

“You’re not hiding,” Rowan said. “You’re just… not resolving.”

Wildcard tilted their head. “I don’t optimize.”

“That’s not an answer.”

“It’s the only one that works.”

They reached a checkpoint Rowan hadn’t noticed until they were already inside it—an open plaza with subtle markers that encouraged flow in particular directions. Wildcard stepped through the center.

Nothing happened.

Rowan’s skin prickled. “They don’t see you.”

“They see me,” Wildcard said. “They just can’t decide what I am.”

They stopped beneath a transit arch where corrected attendants monitored nothing in particular. Wildcard leaned against the stone, unbothered.

“Your problem,” Wildcard continued, “is that you care what things mean.”

Rowan bristled. “Understanding is how I survive.”

“It’s how you leave fingerprints,” Wildcard replied. “Empathy creates data. You share state. You make yourself legible.”

Lio shifted uneasily. “And you don’t?”

Wildcard shrugged. "I refuse repeatability. I don't succeed the same way twice. I don't fail cleanly. The System can't generalize me."

They paused, studying the corrected attendants who still hadn't registered their presence. "Correction is what remains after resistance fails. It's not punishment. It's the residue. The System takes what you fought for and makes it part of the infrastructure."

Rowan's thoughts raced. "If it's that simple, why isn't everyone doing it?"

“Because it’s uncomfortable,” Wildcard said. “And because most people want things to work.”

They straightened, gaze sharpening. "Listen to me. If you do this on purpose—if you recreate what happened—you stop being an accident. You become a method."

Wildcard's expression hardened. "And empathy can wake things the System thought it put to sleep. That's dangerous for everyone. Not just you. Everyone."

Rowan met their eyes. "You think I don't know that?"

Wildcard studied her for a long moment. "Then choose knowing."

They vanished.

One moment they occupied a slice of the world that didn't resolve, and the next the city closed over the space as if it had never been interrupted.

The gaps remained.

Rowan stood very still.

She could walk away. Let the city keep smoothing, keep adapting, keep absorbing variance one quiet correction at a time. She could disappear into the gaps, like Wildcard. Refuse repeatability. Become unplannable. Survive by being unresolved.

The temptation was sharp, almost physical. To stop being legible. To stop leaving traces. To stop being a method the System could learn.

But that wasn't her. That wasn't how she survived.

She survived by understanding. By caring. By being human in a place that optimized for something else.

Even if it left fingerprints.

Or she could push.

“I’m going to do it,” she said.

Lio’s breath caught. “Rowan—”

“I know.” She looked at him. “I know what it costs.”

Kellan folded his arms. “This is reckless.”

“Yes,” Rowan agreed. “That’s the point.”

She chose a man standing near a transit board. He was smiling faintly, posture relaxed, eyes tracking updates that rearranged themselves every few seconds. Corrected. Stable. Approved.

Rowan stepped closer.

She didn’t reach deep.

She brushed.

Empathy flickered—not a plunge, but a lateral echo. The man’s internal state didn’t open. Instead, something rebounded, skidding sideways into the surrounding space.

Hesitation rippled.

The man paused, blinked, and looked down at his hands as if they belonged to someone else. Around them, probability stuttered. A tram announcement repeated itself. A vendor missed a cue and spoke too late.

Residual permissions collided.

Rowan gasped. Pain lanced behind her eyes as the backlash hit harder than before. Time stretched, thinned. Her knees buckled.

Lio caught her.

The city responded instantly.

Not with voices or faces.

Flow patterns shifted. Corrected people repositioned, spacing themselves evenly. A flicker of something sharper moved through the edges of the plaza—possession preparing, then aborting.

Containment.

Wildcard reappeared at the far edge of Rowan’s vision, already stepping backward into irrelevance. Their absence broke a forming chain; a corrected attendant froze, then resumed as if nothing had happened.

Then Wildcard was gone again.

Rowan sagged against Lio, breath ragged. Emotional bleed flooded her—calm that wasn’t hers, approval she wanted to reject and couldn’t quite shake.

Aftermath time swallowed minutes whole.

Kellan had backed away without realizing it, eyes on Rowan like she’d become unpredictable terrain.

Tara hovered close, shaking. “They’re watching us.”

“Yes,” Rowan whispered. Her head throbbed. “And they learned something.”

She felt it then—a glimpse, sharp and fleeting. Interpretability climbing. Tolerance narrowing.

The city adjusting its assumptions.

Rowan closed her eyes.

She had crossed a line.

When she opened them, the gaps were smaller. More careful. As if the System were now aware that some failures were intentional.

Privilege escalation.

Rowan straightened slowly, forcing herself upright.

“Next time,” she said quietly, “it won’t be an accident.”

The city did not disagree.
