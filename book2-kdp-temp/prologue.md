# Prologue
## Audit Window Opened

The first thing Rowan noticed was the silence.

Not the kind you earned after a long day—the soft hush where the world exhales and you can pretend you're safe. This silence sat wrong. It made her check her ears, then her pulse, then the angle of her head like she could tilt herself back into normal sound.

The camp had gone quiet in a way that felt deliberate. Her fire still burned, a ragged orange tongue licking at damp wood, but it wasn't crackling the way it should. Even the sparks seemed reluctant to leave, as if they'd been told to stay put.

Rowan held her hands over the flame anyway. Heat seeped into her knuckles slow and grudging, not the bright, eager warmth she'd come to rely on. Across the fire, a small kettle perched on three stones. The water inside barely trembled. She'd set it there before dark because having a plan—boil, pour, sip—gave her something to do with her hands while her brain ran laps.

It had worked then. It wasn't working now.

She reached for the tin cup and stopped halfway.

A thin film of frost had crawled up the cup's side. It shouldn't have. The night wasn't that cold. The air had been damp and mild enough earlier that her hair stuck to the nape of her neck.

Frost meant the System was leaning on the world.

Rowan pulled her cloak tighter and forced herself to breathe through her nose. The air smelled like wet soil and smoke and something faintly metallic, like blood on old coins.

On her left, Lio shifted near the fire. He sat close enough to the heat that the edges of his sleeves steamed faintly, drying where they'd gotten damp from fog. He didn't look at her right away. He was busy with a familiar ritual: feeding the fire in small, careful pieces like he could talk the night into behaving.

He slid a twig in. Waited. Listened.

Then, quietly, he said, "You're doing the thing where you stop blinking."

Rowan blinked. Once. Twice. Her eyes stung from staring too long. "I'm fine."

Lio made a soft sound—half skepticism, half acceptance. He didn't argue. That was his gift and his curse. "Do you want the last of the dried fruit?"

Rowan looked down at the pouch by her knee. The leather was stiff with salt. She'd been saving it, because saving things made her feel she had a future.

"No," she said. "You can have it."

"Mm," Lio replied, not agreeing, not refusing. He tossed another stick into the fire and watched it catch reluctantly.

On the other side of the camp, Kellan paced the perimeter in a slow, irritated loop. He walked like he was trying to keep his muscles from remembering fear. Every few steps, he paused, cocked his head, and stared into the trees.

Not because he heard something.

Because he didn't.

Kellan stopped behind Rowan, close enough that his shadow fell across her shoulder. "It's too quiet."

Rowan kept her eyes on the frost line creeping along the cup. "Yeah."

Kellan's boots crunched softly on dead leaves. He came around, crouched on the opposite side of the fire, and put his forearms on his knees. Firelight sharpened his cheekbones and made his eyes look darker than they were. "Don't 'yeah' me. Say what you're thinking."

Rowan's mouth went dry. "I'm thinking it's the System."

Kellan's jaw tightened like that was both obvious and unacceptable. "And?"

Rowan wanted to say it can't do anything new. She wanted to believe the System was a machine that only repeated what it already knew. But she'd watched it learn. She'd watched it adapt—slowly, clumsily, but undeniably.

She'd watched it react to Wildcard by refusing to admit Wildcard existed at all.

"It's leaning closer," Rowan said.

Lio's hands paused over the firewood. "How can you tell?"

Rowan nodded toward the cup without looking up. "That."

Lio leaned in, eyes narrowing. Frost. His mouth tightened. "That wasn't there before."

Kellan followed Rowan's gaze, then looked up at the empty air above the fire the way you look at a camera you can't see. "Is it going to do something?"

Rowan didn't answer fast enough.

A notification chimed.

Not sound—pressure. A tiny pulse behind her eyes, like someone had tapped the inside of her skull. Rowan's vision blurred for half a second, and then the UI slid into place with a smoothness that made her stomach drop.

She didn't look up right away.

She watched her hands—pale in the firelight, soot in the creases of her thumb—and waited for the familiar spike of nausea that came with the System's attention.

It didn't come.

That was worse.

The UI appeared without pain. Efficient. Polished. Like someone had patched the rough edges she'd gotten used to.

Rowan lifted her eyes.

A thin gray bar hung in the air, perfectly level, perfectly centered.



[SYSTEM]
NOTICE: COMPLIANCE AUDIT INITIATED
Subject: Rowan Mercer
Scope: Behavioral Consistency / Outcome Divergence
Window: OPEN
Observer: [REDACTED]
[/SYSTEM]



Kellan swore under his breath. Lio went very still, his fingers still holding a stick of wood as if it mattered.

Rowan's throat tightened. She forced her voice into something steady. "Let me read."

Kellan's laugh was sharp and humorless. "As if we have a choice."

A second pane slid in beneath the first, text dense enough to make her eyes want to skim and classify.



[SYSTEM]
Audit Trigger: Cumulative anomaly threshold exceeded.
Category: Choice Pattern Deviation
Flag(s):
• Non-Optimizing Action Chain
• Undocumented Mechanic Interaction
• Persistent Residual State
• Unresolved Observer Gap
[/SYSTEM]



Rowan's tongue stuck to the roof of her mouth.

Unresolved observer gap.

She'd seen that absence once—the moment the world had stuttered at the edge of her vision and the System insisted the space was empty even while a person moved through it like they belonged to a different set of rules.

Wildcard.

They'd all been there, clustered too close together in the wet dark, pretending they weren't desperate for an answer. Wildcard had looked at them like they were a problem that would either solve itself or kill them.

You're loud, Wildcard had said, eyes flicking to Rowan. Even when you think you're quiet.

Lio's voice cut in softly, almost reluctantly. "That's… about them."

Rowan nodded once, too small to feel like agreement.

Kellan leaned forward until the fire reflected in his eyes. "Tell me you didn't get tagged just for standing in the same clearing."

Rowan stared at the floating words. "It thinks I'm connected."

"Are you?" Kellan's question came out too fast. Too sharp. Like he could stab the answer into being safe.

Rowan opened her mouth and closed it again. Honesty mattered. So did survival.

"I talked," she said finally. "We all did. That's all."

Kellan exhaled hard through his nose. "That's never 'all' with this thing."

The UI flickered, as if irritated by their tone.

Another line appeared beneath the flags, clinical and uncaring.



[SYSTEM]
Audit Action: Retroactive evaluation of recent decisions.
Audit Consequences: Adjustment of rewards / encounter probability / social alignment metrics.
Note: Subject may experience perception latency, UI throttling, and environmental stabilization attempts.
[/SYSTEM]



Lio's eyes went to the trees. The fog between the trunks sat too flat, too unmoving, like a sheet of cloth hung in place. "Environmental stabilization," he murmured. "That's the frost."

Kellan's fists clenched. "So it can just punish you."

"It can adjust," Rowan said, and the word tasted like corporate euphemism. Adjustment. Like a performance review that decided your rent.

Kellan scoffed. "Same thing."

Rowan's mind tried to do what it always did when she was afraid: build a model. Monitoring. Alerting. Incident response. You didn't fix an outage by staring at the graphs until they behaved. You identified what changed. What was failing. How fast it was spreading.

Okay.

What changed?

Book one had been chaos—drop-in, scramble, survive. She'd refused the easy prompts. She'd pushed back in small ways that felt private. She'd made choices the System didn't reward because rewarding them would encourage others to try.

Then it had gone quiet.

Waiting was never good.

Kellan's voice pulled her back. "Rowan."

She realized she'd been staring at the same line of text for too long. "I'm thinking."

"Don't do that alone," Kellan snapped, then softened it with effort. "Don't go somewhere we can't reach you."

The words hit harder than he intended. Rowan turned her head. Kellan looked angry in the way people looked when fear had nowhere else to go.

Lio, still by the fire, didn't move closer, but his attention locked on her like a hand on the back of her neck. Present. Steady.

Rowan nodded once. "I'm here."

Lio asked, gentle but not indulgent, "What do you need?"

The offer was simple. It made something in Rowan's chest ache. She rubbed her thumb over the pad of her index finger—an old habit from long meetings and long nights and pretending she wasn't scared.

"I need you both to not do anything sudden," she said.

Kellan's eyebrows lifted. "Sudden?"

Rowan gestured vaguely at the floating panes. "It's watching for patterns. If we act like frightened prey, it files that. If we act like heroes, it files that. If we act as if we're gaming it—"

"It files that," Kellan finished, bitterness thick in his voice.

Rowan's mouth twisted. "And then it adapts."

Lio's gaze flicked to her face. "So we do nothing?"

"No." Rowan shook her head. "We do… boring."

Kellan gave a short, incredulous laugh. "Boring gets you killed out here."

"Boring gets you missed," Rowan said, and immediately regretted how close that sounded to Wildcard's world.

Kellan caught it anyway. His eyes narrowed. "That's what they do."

Rowan didn't answer. She didn't trust her voice.

The air behind her eyes pulsed again. A third pane unfolded, longer than the others, lined like a contract. Rowan felt her stomach dip as it scrolled.



[SYSTEM]

[/SYSTEM]



Lio sucked in a slow breath. "It's going through you."

"Like a ledger," Kellan said, voice flat.

Rowan couldn't stop staring at Item 05 and 06. The redactions weren't black bars. They were blankness, as if the words had never existed. As if the System didn't even have placeholders for what it couldn't categorize.

Her scalp prickled. The fire popped softly—one tiny spark rose and died without sound.

Rowan whispered, "It's missing data."

Kellan's mouth twisted. "Good."

"No." The word came out sharper than she meant. Rowan swallowed and tried again. "Missing data makes it nervous."

Lio tilted his head. "Why?"

Rowan tried to explain without slipping into lecture. Without making herself a narrator. "Because… it can't predict what happens next."

Kellan's gaze flicked to the fog again, and this time he looked like he could see the pressure in the air. "So it tightens the world."

Environmental stabilization attempts.

The frost had spread beyond the cup now, creeping along the closest branches in thin white lace. The fog sat low and unmoving, a flat sheet between trunks. It didn't curl or drift. It just waited, like a held breath.

Rowan rubbed her palms on her pants. They were damp with sweat despite the chill.

Lio's voice went quiet. "Rowan. What does it want from you?"

Rowan's eyes snapped back to the UI.

A new line had appeared at the bottom of the audit pane, understated but unmistakable.



[SYSTEM]
Acknowledgment Required.
Proceed?
[YES] [LATER]
[/SYSTEM]



Rowan stared at the buttons like they were mines.

If she hit YES, she stepped into whatever the System had prepared. If she hit LATER, she admitted fear—or worse, she created a delay that would be recorded as noncompliance. She could almost feel it slotting her choice into a column.

Her heartbeat thudded in her ears, the only real sound in the too-quiet night.

Kellan's hand hovered near his belt knife. Not drawing it. Just remembering it existed.

Lio's hands were open on his knees, palms up, like he was telling his body to stay calm even if his mind didn't believe it.

Rowan's mouth tasted like copper. She looked down at her hands again just to anchor herself. Nails bitten too short. A smear of soot on her thumb. Real. Human.

In her old life, audits had been paperwork and polite lies. There'd been calendars and timeboxes and carefully phrased emails with "per our last conversation" tucked like knives inside courtesy.

This audit had teeth.

Rowan thought of Wildcard moving through impossible empty space. Thought of the System refusing to acknowledge them. Thought of the way the UI had stuttered like a program hitting an unhandled exception.

Loud even when you think you're quiet.

Maybe Wildcard had meant behavior. Maybe Wildcard had meant emotion. Maybe Wildcard had meant the way Rowan couldn't hide the fact that she cared, even when caring was a vulnerability.

A sharp, unwanted longing cut through her—clean and bright as glass. Her bed. The dull hum of a refrigerator. The weight of her daughter's sleepy body against her shoulder, warm and unthinking. The sound of a world that didn't grade every breath she took.

The longing spiked—

—and the UI trembled.

Not much. A tiny jitter at the edge of the pane, like it had to re-center its focus. Like it had flinched.

Rowan froze.

Lio noticed immediately. His gaze snapped from the fire to her face. "What?"

Rowan didn't answer. She watched the UI like it might betray itself again.

A thin line of text appeared, faint enough she almost missed it.



[SYSTEM]
Perception latency detected. Recalibrating.
[/SYSTEM]



Her pulse kicked. She forced her face to stay blank.

Perception latency.

The System was lagging.

Kellan leaned in, voice low. "It's… what? Glitching?"

Rowan swallowed. "Not exactly."

Lio's brows drew together. "Rowan."

Rowan looked at them both, and the fear in her chest shifted—not lessening, but sharpening into something usable. "When I said boring," she said, "I didn't mean empty."

Kellan frowned. "You're doing it again. Speaking in riddles."

"I'm noticing," Rowan insisted. "It can track what we do. It's good at that. But it might not be as good at tracking what we—" She searched for the words that didn't sound like a manual. "What we carry. What we feel."

Kellan's eyes narrowed. "That's your new theory?"

Rowan didn't like how small it sounded when spoken aloud. "It's not a theory. It's… a crack."

Lio's voice stayed gentle, but it didn't let her drift away. "Okay. A crack. What do we do with it?"

The buttons waited, patient as a trap.

Rowan's finger lifted, hovering in the air between YES and LATER. She didn't trust either option. She didn't like being forced into binary choices. The System loved binaries. The System ate them.

So Rowan did something small and stubborn and human.

She reached into her pocket and pulled out the strip of dried fruit she'd been saving. It was leathery and sour and too expensive to waste. She tore it into three pieces with her teeth because her hands were shaking just enough that she didn't trust them.

She held one out to Kellan. One to Lio. Took the smallest for herself.

Kellan stared at it like she'd offered him a spell. "Now?"

"Yes," Rowan said. Her voice came out rougher than she meant. "Eat."

Lio accepted his piece without comment, as if he understood the point before she did. He chewed slowly, eyes half-lidded, letting the taste pull him into the moment.

Kellan hesitated, then took it. His fingers brushed hers—cold, calloused. He popped it into his mouth and grimaced at the sourness.

"God," he muttered. "That's awful."

"It's real," Rowan said, and surprised herself with the way her throat tightened. "It tastes like something. I need us to do something that isn't for it."

For a heartbeat, they were just three people by a fire, sharing a small cruelty of flavor and laughing at it without sound.

The UI flickered again. A faint ripple ran through the audit pane like a screen refresh.

Rowan kept chewing. Kept breathing. Kept her face bland and uninteresting while her chest stayed full of that sharp, dangerous wanting.

Then she selected LATER.

The button dimmed as if pressed by an invisible finger. The UI didn't vanish. It didn't punish her immediately. It simply changed.



[SYSTEM]
Acknowledgment deferred.
Audit Window: ACTIVE (00:59:59)
Note: Continued anomaly accumulation may result in forced evaluation.
[/SYSTEM]



A countdown appeared beneath it, numbers too clean, too bright. The colon blinked like an eye.

Kellan exhaled. "So we have an hour."

Lio's gaze stayed on the fog. "Or it has an hour."

Rowan nodded once. Her tongue was still sour. Her hands were still warm from the fire, and she clung to that warmth like proof she wasn't entirely made of fear.

An hour was nothing. An hour was enough time for the System to rearrange an entire region if it decided the variable needed containment.

Rowan looked at the redacted lines again—Item 05, Item 06—and felt, suddenly, like she was standing on a floorboard that hadn't been nailed down properly. Like the world beneath her could tilt at any moment.

Kellan's voice went quieter. "If it forces evaluation… what happens?"

Rowan watched the frost creep farther along the branch tips. A small bird sat motionless on a low limb, feathers puffed, eyes closed. It looked asleep. Or frozen. The fog didn't move. The fire still didn't crackle.

Rowan answered honestly. "I don't know."

Kellan's jaw flexed. "That's not—"

"I don't know," Rowan repeated, and the fear finally showed in the tremor of her breath. She hated it. She let it happen anyway. "But I think it wants me to become predictable."

Lio's eyes flicked to her face, seeing too much. "And will you?" he asked.

Rowan looked at them. Really looked.

Kellan's anger, sharp-edged and protective. Lio's quiet steadiness, the way he'd taken the fruit without needing a speech. The fact that they'd all stood with Wildcard and left with no answers, only warnings.

A warmth stirred in Rowan's chest—small, fierce, almost painful. Caring made her loud. Caring made her visible.

The UI's edge shimmered again, a faint stutter like a skipped frame.

Rowan kept her face steady. "No," she said softly. "But I might have to learn how to be unpredictable without dragging you into the worst of it."

Kellan let out a short laugh that didn't have humor in it. "That's not reassuring."

Rowan's mouth twitched. "Yeah. I know."

Lio leaned forward and nudged the kettle a fraction closer to the heat. "Then we do it together," he said, like it was the simplest thing in the world. Like it was obvious. "No more disappearing into your head."

Rowan swallowed hard and nodded once, because if she tried to speak, her voice might break.

The countdown ticked on, bright and indifferent.

Rowan reached for another piece of wood and fed it into the flames.

It caught slowly, reluctant—like the world was waiting to see what she'd do next.
