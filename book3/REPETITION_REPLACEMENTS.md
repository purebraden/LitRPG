# Repetition Replacement Guide

## "Even when it cost everything" - Alternatives:
- "Even knowing the price"
- "Despite the cost"
- "Knowing what it would cost"
- "Accepting the price"
- "Willing to pay"
- "No matter the cost"
- Sometimes just show the action without stating the cost
- Sometimes remove entirely - let the action speak

## "Like a function that returned the expected value but had side effects" - Alternatives:
- "Like code that compiled but shouldn't"
- "Like a feature that worked perfectly but consumed resources"
- "Like a database normalization - removing redundancy, but losing information"
- "Like a recursive function with no exit condition"
- "Like watching someone's code crash in real-time"
- "Like a memory leak consuming someone's personality"
- "Like corrupted data—some files intact, some lost forever"
- "Like a partial backup—the structure was there, but pieces were missing"
- "Like a distributed system where every node agreed except you"
- "Like a linter that marked your code as 'unstable'"
- Sometimes just describe the feeling without the metaphor

## "Because they were human. Because they felt. Because they connected." - Alternatives:
- Sometimes just show the connection
- Sometimes use different language
- Sometimes let the action speak
- Remove entirely if the action already shows it
