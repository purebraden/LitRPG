# Chapter 5B — River's Perspective: The Choice

River had been resisting for six months.

Six months of struggle. Six months of pain. Six months of exhaustion.

And they were done.

They sat in the gardens, their hands shaking, their breath coming in short gasps. The pain was constant now—not just physical, though that was bad enough, but emotional. Existential. The weight of resistance, the cost of staying human, the price of connection.

It was too much.

River had watched people align. They'd seen the peace in their eyes, the relief in their posture, the certainty in their movements. They'd seen people who'd been struggling, in pain, desperate for relief, find it through alignment.

And they'd been happy.

Genuinely happy.

River wanted that.

They wanted peace.

They wanted relief.

They wanted to stop fighting.

They'd tried. They'd really tried. They'd resisted. They'd struggled. They'd fought to stay human, to stay connected, to stay feeling.

But it was costing them.

Not just physically—though the injuries were mounting, the exhaustion was crushing—but emotionally. They were losing themselves. They could feel it. The weight of resistance, the cost of staying human, the price of connection.

It was too much.

River looked around the gardens. People worked methodically, their movements coordinated, their interactions smooth. They were happy. Safe. Productive. At peace.

Everything River wanted.

Everything River needed.

Everything River had been desperate for.

River's hands shook.

They could go to the clinic.

They could get help.

They could find peace.

They could stop fighting.

The thought was like a promise.

A promise of peace.

A promise of relief.

A promise of rest.

Everything they'd been desperate for.

Everything they'd needed.

River stood, their movements careful, their expression determined. They'd been struggling. They'd been in pain. They'd been exhausted.

And they were done.

They walked through the gardens, their steps careful, their mind racing. The clinic was ahead. Dr. Chen was there. She could help. She could guide. She could help them align.

They could find peace.

They could stop fighting.

They could be safe.

Everything they'd been desperate for.

Everything they'd needed.

River's throat closed.

Rowan had tried to help.

Rowan had tried to convince them.

Rowan had tried to make them see.

But River couldn't see it.

What was wrong with peace?

What was wrong with relief?

What was wrong with rest?

River had been fighting for six months. Struggling for six months. Resisting for six months. And it had cost them. Not just physically—though that was bad enough—but emotionally. Existentially.

They were losing themselves.

They knew it.

And they were tired of it.

They just wanted peace.

They just wanted relief.

They just wanted to stop fighting.

And the clinic offered that.

Everything they'd been desperate for.

Everything they'd needed.

River reached the clinic door and stopped, their hand hovering over the handle. This was it. This was the choice. This was the moment.

They could go in.

They could get help.

They could find peace.

They could stop fighting.

Or they could turn around.

They could keep struggling.

They could keep fighting.

They could keep resisting.

River's hands shook.

They'd been resisting for six months.

Six months of struggle. Six months of pain. Six months of exhaustion.

And they were done.

River opened the door and walked inside.

The clinic was clean. Organized. Efficient. People sat in chairs, waiting. Some looked pained. Some looked desperate. Some looked relieved.

All of them wanted peace.

All of them wanted relief.

All of them wanted to stop fighting.

River sat in a chair and waited.

Their hands shook.

Their breath came in short gasps.

Their mind raced.

They could do this.

They could get help.

They could find peace.

They could stop fighting.

Everything they'd been desperate for.

Everything they'd needed.

A woman came out of a room, her expression peaceful, her movements calm. She looked… better. Calmer. More efficient. More at peace.

She'd been struggling.

She'd been in pain.

She'd been desperate for relief.

And she'd found it.

River's throat closed.

They could do this.

They could find peace.

They could stop fighting.

Everything they'd been desperate for.

Everything they'd needed.

"River?"

River looked up.

Dr. Chen stood there, her expression kind, her movements gentle.

"Come with me," she said. "We can help. We can guide. We can help you find peace."

River stood, their movements careful, their expression determined.

They could do this.

They could find peace.

They could stop fighting.

Everything they'd been desperate for.

Everything they'd needed.

River followed Dr. Chen into a room.

The room was clean. Organized. Efficient. A chair sat in the center. Dr. Chen gestured to it.

"Sit," she said. "We'll help. We'll guide. We'll help you align."

River sat, their hands shaking, their breath coming in short gasps.

They could do this.

They could find peace.

They could stop fighting.

Everything they'd been desperate for.

Everything they'd needed.

Dr. Chen sat across from them, her expression kind, her movements gentle.

"Tell me," she said. "What do you need?"

River's throat closed.

They needed peace.

They needed relief.

They needed to stop fighting.

Everything they'd been desperate for.

Everything they'd needed.

"Please," River said, their voice small. "I just want peace."

Dr. Chen smiled, warm, kind, genuine.

"Then let's begin."

River closed their eyes and let themselves feel it.

The warmth.

The comfort.

The absence of fear.

This was what they'd needed.

This was what they'd been desperate for.

Safety. Rest. Peace.

And the clinic offered that.

Everything they'd been desperate for.

Everything they'd needed.

River could do this.

They could find peace.

They could stop fighting.

Everything they'd been desperate for.

Everything they'd needed.

River let themselves feel it.

The warmth.

The comfort.

The absence of fear.

This was what they'd needed.

This was what they'd been desperate for.

Safety. Rest. Peace.

And the clinic offered that.

That was enough.

For now.

For as long as they could maintain it.

River let themselves feel it.

The warmth.

The comfort.

The absence of fear.

This was what they'd needed.

This was what they'd been desperate for.

Safety. Rest. Peace.

And the clinic offered that.

That was enough.
