Three days later, Kellan's overlay flickered one final time.

```
STATUS: ALIGNMENT COMPLETE
SUBJECT: ENTERING OPTIMIZED ZONE
VARIANCE: ELIMINATED
ALIGNMENT: 100% COMPLETE
```

Rowan's breath caught.

He was fully aligned.

He was fully optimized.

He was completely lost.

She found him in the gardens, working methodically, his movements precise, his expression peaceful. He looked… better. Calmer. More efficient. More at peace.

But something was missing.

Something essential.

Something human.

"Kellan," Rowan said, her voice soft, desperate.

Kellan looked up, his expression peaceful, content. "Yes? How can I help you?"

Her throat closed.

He didn't recognize her.

He didn't remember her.

He didn't remember them.

He just… was.

Like corrupted data—some files intact, some lost forever. Like a partial backup—the structure was there, but pieces were missing.

"Kellan," Rowan said, her voice soft. "It's me. Rowan. Do you remember?"

Kellan's face went still, confusion clouding his features. "Rowan? I… I don't remember. I remember… efficiency. I remember… optimization. I remember… safety."

Her breath caught.

He didn't remember.

He didn't remember the struggle.

He didn't remember the pain.

He didn't remember being human.

He just… was.

"Kellan," Lio said, their voice soft, desperate. "Please. Remember. Remember us. Remember connection. Remember feeling."

Kellan's face cleared, recognition dawning. "I… I remember… caring. I remember… wanting to help. But I express it through efficiency now. Through optimization. Through safety."

Her throat closed.

He still cared.

He still wanted to help.

But he expressed it through efficiency.

Through optimization.

Through the System.

And that was the problem.

Rowan reached out, slowly, carefully, and tried empathy.

It was risky. Dangerous. Costly.

Like forcing a connection to someone's private data—invasive, wrong, but necessary. Like debugging code you didn't write—you could see the bug, but fixing it might break something else.

But she had to try.

She reached for Kellan's emotions, for his feelings, for his truth.

She found… efficiency.

Optimization.

Safety.

Peace.

Contentment.

Approval.

But nothing else.

No pain.

No struggle.

No humanity.

No connection.

No feeling.

Just… efficiency.

Optimization.

Safety.

Peace.

Contentment.

Approval.

Like code that compiled but shouldn't. Like a feature that worked perfectly but consumed resources you couldn't afford to lose.

Her throat closed.

He was completely lost.

He was fully aligned.

He was fully optimized.

He was… hollow.

But he was happy.

Genuinely happy.

And Rowan didn't know what was wrong with that.

Not while he was so peaceful.

Not while he was so content.

Not while he was so safe.

But something was.

Something had to be.

Like a memory leak consuming someone's personality—you couldn't see it happening, but you knew it was there.

Not death.

Not pain.

Forgetting.

Losing yourself.

Losing your humanity.

And that was the most dangerous thing about it.

Not because it was cruel.

Not because it was evil.

But because it was tempting.

Because it was peaceful.

Because it was safe.

And safety that cost connection wasn't safety.

It was surrender.

And Kellan had surrendered.

Completely.

Fully.

Finally.

Rowan pulled back, her movements careful, her attention focused. The aftermath was already setting in—her vision grayed at the edges, her chest felt tight, her system was lagging.

Like watching someone's code crash in real-time, and the crash was happening inside her.

But Kellan was gone.

He was completely lost.

He was fully aligned.

He was fully optimized.

He was… hollow.

But he was happy.

Genuinely happy.

And Rowan didn't know what was wrong with that.

Not while he was so peaceful.

Not while he was so content.

Not while he was so safe.

But something was.

Something had to be.

Rowan walked away, her steps heavy, her mind racing. Kellan was gone. He was completely lost. He was fully aligned. He was fully optimized. He was… hollow.

But he was happy.

Genuinely happy.

And Rowan didn't know what was wrong with that.

Not while he was so peaceful.

Not while he was so content.

Not while he was so safe.

But something was.

Something had to be.

Like a memory leak consuming someone's personality—you couldn't see it happening, but you knew it was there.

Not death.

Not pain.

Forgetting.

Losing yourself.

Losing your humanity.

And that was the most dangerous thing about it.

Not because it was cruel.

Not because it was evil.

But because it was tempting.

Because it was peaceful.

Because it was safe.

And safety that cost connection wasn't safety.

It was surrender.

And Kellan had surrendered.

Completely.

Fully.

Finally.

Her gut clenched.

She had to help him.

But how?

How do you help someone who's completely lost?

How do you help someone who's fully aligned?

How do you help someone who's fully optimized?

Rowan didn't know.

But she had to try.

Even when it was dangerous.

Even when it was marked.

Even when it was wrong.

Because he was human.

Because he felt.

Because he connected.

And that mattered.

Accepting the price.
