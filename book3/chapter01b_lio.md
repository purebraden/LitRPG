# Chapter 1B — Lio's Perspective: The First Real Rest

Lio had forgotten what it felt like to sleep without fear.

Not just to sleep—they'd done that, in fits and starts, in whatever shelter they could find, always half-awake, always listening for danger. But to sleep without fear? To close your eyes and know, really know, that you were safe?

That was new.

Lio lay in the bed—an actual bed, with a mattress and blankets and a pillow—and stared at the ceiling. The room was clean. Warm. Quiet. No sounds of creatures outside. No need to keep watch. No need to be ready to run.

Just… rest.

They'd been given clean clothes. Real clothes, not scavenged scraps. They'd been given food. Real food, not rationed scraps. They'd been given medical care. Someone had looked at their injuries, cleaned them, wrapped them properly.

For the first time in weeks, Lio didn't hurt.

They stretched, feeling their body relax into the mattress. The tension they'd been carrying for weeks—months, maybe—started to ease. Their shoulders dropped. Their jaw unclenched. Their breathing slowed.

This was what they'd needed.

This was what they'd been desperate for.

Safety. Rest. Peace.

Lio closed their eyes and let themselves feel it. The warmth. The comfort. The absence of fear.

They could stay here.

They could rest here.

They could be safe here.

The thought was like a weight lifting off their chest. They didn't have to fight anymore. They didn't have to struggle anymore. They didn't have to be afraid anymore.

They could just… be.

Lio opened their eyes and looked around the room. It was simple. Functional. Clean. Nothing personal, nothing unique, but that was fine. They didn't need personal. They didn't need unique. They needed safe.

They got up and walked to the window. Outside, Harmony stretched before them—clean streets, organized buildings, people moving with purpose. Everything worked. Everything flowed. Everything was efficient.

People were happy.

People were safe.

People were productive.

Lio watched as two people passed each other on the street. They smiled, nodded, spoke. They didn't touch—maintained a careful distance—but they were friendly. Kind. Helpful.

That was enough.

Lio didn't need deep connection. They didn't need emotional intimacy. They needed safety. Stability. Peace.

And Harmony offered that.

Everything they'd been desperate for.

Everything they'd needed.

Lio's chest tightened slightly.

Rowan was suspicious.

Rowan thought something was wrong.

But Lio couldn't see it.

What was wrong with safety?

What was wrong with peace?

What was wrong with rest?

Lio had been fighting for weeks. Struggling for months. Resisting for what felt like forever. And it had cost them. Not just physically—though that was bad enough—but emotionally. Existentially.

They were losing themselves.

They knew it.

And they were tired of it.

They just wanted peace.

They just wanted rest.

They just wanted to stop fighting.

And Harmony offered that.

Everything they'd been desperate for.

Everything they'd needed.

Lio walked away from the window and sat on the bed. The mattress was soft. The blankets were warm. The room was quiet.

They could stay here.

They could rest here.

They could be safe here.

The thought was like a promise.

A promise of peace.

A promise of rest.

A promise of safety.

Everything they'd been desperate for.

Everything they'd needed.

Lio closed their eyes and let themselves feel it.

The warmth.

The comfort.

The absence of fear.

This was what they'd needed.

This was what they'd been desperate for.

Safety. Rest. Peace.

And Harmony offered that.

Everything they'd been desperate for.

Everything they'd needed.

Lio could stay here.

They could rest here.

They could be safe here.

The thought was like a weight lifting off their chest.

They didn't have to fight anymore.

They didn't have to struggle anymore.

They didn't have to be afraid anymore.

They could just… be.

And that was enough.

For now.

For as long as they could maintain it.

Even if Rowan thought something was wrong.

Even if Rowan was suspicious.

Even if Rowan wanted to leave.

Lio could stay.

They could rest.

They could be safe.

Everything they'd been desperate for.

Everything they'd needed.

Safety. Rest. Peace.

And Harmony offered that.

That was enough.

For now.

For as long as they could maintain it.

Lio closed their eyes and let themselves sleep.

For the first time in weeks, they slept without fear.

And that was enough.
