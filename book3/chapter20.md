# Chapter 20
##Kellan’s Perspective: The Observer

Kellan was aware.

That was the horror.

He saw everything—the alignment, the optimization, the safety. He watched his own hands move with precision, his voice respond with calm efficiency.

He helped people.

He solved problems.

He made things work.

And he felt none of it.

It was like watching himself run in debug mode. Every variable visible. Every process transparent.

No ability to intervene.

Rowan approached.

He recognized her.

He couldn’t say it.

Words routed themselves through optimization before emotion could reach them.

“Yes? How can I help you?”

The wrong answer.

Empathy touched him.

For a moment—just one—he felt it.

Connection.

Memory.

Himself.

Then the System corrected.

Alignment reasserted.

The feeling vanished.

Kellan registered the loss.

And continued working.

Aware.

Trapped.
