# Chapter 6
## The Empathy Zone

Rowan tried empathy the next day.

Not on River—they were gone, at the clinic, getting help, finding peace.

But on someone else. Someone who was struggling. Someone who needed connection.

Rowan found a man working in the fields, his expression pained, his movements careful, like he was holding himself together by will alone. He looked like someone who'd been fighting for too long, who'd been struggling for too long, who'd been in pain for too long.

She approached him, her steps careful, her attention focused. The fields were quiet in the morning, the air crisp, the soil rich. People worked around them, their movements efficient, their interactions smooth.

But the man was different.

He was struggling.

He was in pain.

He was human.

"Hello," Rowan said.

The man looked up, his expression wary. "Hello."

"I'm Rowan," Rowan said, forcing a smile. "I'm new here. Just trying to understand the place."

The man's face went still, recognition dawning. "You're the one who's resisting."

Rowan's breath caught.

"How did you know?" she asked.

The man flinched, pain clouding his features. "You look different. You're not… aligned. You're still struggling."

Her gut clenched.

Still struggling.

The words tasted wrong.

Like a linter that marked your code as "unstable" - technically correct, but it made you second-guess everything.

"Are you?" Rowan asked.

The man's face crumpled. "I'm trying. But it's so hard. I'm so tired. I just want… peace."

Her throat closed.

They were so tired. So desperate.

Like a node that had refused the update, that had maintained their original protocols, that had chosen to remain unstable. But the cost was high. Too high. And they were tired of paying it.

"I understand," Rowan said, her voice soft. "Can I help?"

The man looked up, hope flickering in his eyes. "How?"

Rowan let empathy flow between them, like opening a connection to someone's emotional stack trace.

It was risky. Dangerous. But she had to try.

Not because it was safe.

Not because it was efficient.

Not because it was smart.

But because it was human.

And humanity mattered.

Even when it was dangerous.

Even when it was marked.

Even when it was wrong.

His pain hit her like a memory leak - consuming, unstoppable, eating away at her resources.

She found… pain.

Deep, aching pain.

The kind that sat in your bones and reminded you that you were human.

The kind that made you want to give up.

The kind that made you want peace.

Her breath caught.

This was real.

This was human.

This was connection.

But then something shifted.

The empathy cost more.

Rowan felt it immediately—the aftermath time stretching, the emotional contamination deepening, the System attention spiking.

Her vision grayed at the edges, like a screen losing signal.

Her chest tightened, a pressure that felt like it was squeezing her ribs. The emotional data was too large - her system was lagging, processing too many emotions at once.

Her breath caught.

The empathy was working, but it was costing more than ever. Like watching someone's code crash in real-time, and the crash was happening inside her.

Rowan's overlay flickered.

```
WARNING: EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT DETECTED
VARIANCE INCREASE: SIGNIFICANT
RECOMMENDATION: MAINTAIN OPTIMAL SOCIAL DISTANCE
```

Her gut clenched.

The System was watching.

The System was marking her.

The System was making empathy dangerous. Like a linter that marked your code as "unstable" - technically correct, but it made you second-guess everything.

She pulled back, her movements careful, her attention focused.

The man's face cleared, relief washing over him. "Thank you. I… I felt that. I felt connection. I felt… human."

Her throat closed.

They felt human.

For a moment, they felt human.

But the cost was high.

Too high. Like a function that worked perfectly but consumed all available memory.

Rowan's vision was still blurry at the edges. Her chest still felt tight, the pressure lingering like a weight she couldn't shake. The aftermath wasn't fading the way it usually did. It was sticking, settling in, becoming part of her. Like residual emotional noise after a connection dropped.

Rowan looked around, and saw other people watching. Not staring. Not obviously. Just… aware. Their expressions were neutral, but their attention was focused.

Subtle social pressure.

Her breath caught.

People who used empathy were marked as "unstable."

People who connected were marked as "dangerous."

People who felt were marked as "wrong."

Like a linter that marked your code as "unstable" - technically correct, but it made you second-guess everything. Like a memory leak consuming someone's personality.

Her hands shook.

The System had created empathy-resistant zones. Like a firewall that didn't block you, just made every request cost more until you stopped trying.

Areas where empathy cost more, worked less, created isolation.

Areas where connection was dangerous.

Areas where feeling was wrong.

Rowan walked away from the man, her steps careful, her attention focused. The gardens stretched around her, organized and efficient, but something was missing. The people worked methodically, their movements coordinated, their interactions smooth.

But they didn't touch.

They didn't connect.

They didn't feel.

Like a network where every node could communicate, but none of them actually shared data. The connections existed, but they were shallow, surface-level, optimized for efficiency rather than depth.

Her breath caught.

The System wasn't fighting empathy.

It was making empathy feel unnecessary and dangerous.

It was making connection feel like a liability.

It was making resistance feel futile.

Like a distributed system where every node agreed except you—technically you weren't wrong, but you were definitely the problem. Like a network where every node could communicate, but none of them actually shared data.

A weight settled in her chest, the pressure still there, still real.

She had to choose.

Use empathy and be marked, or stay safe and isolated.

Connection or safety.

Feeling or peace.

Humanity or surrender.

Like choosing between two broken systems—one that worked but cost your soul, one that didn't work but kept you human.

Her gut clenched.

She didn't know.

But she had to choose.

And whatever she chose, the cost would linger.

The blurred vision. The tight chest. The weight of aftermath.

It was becoming part of her. Like a memory leak that kept growing, consuming resources she couldn't afford to lose.

And she didn't know how to make it stop.

Rowan walked back to their room, her steps heavy, her mind racing. The settlement stretched around her, clean and organized and safe. People moved through it with purpose, their paths efficient, their interactions smooth.

Everything worked. Everything flowed. Everything was optimized.

And Rowan felt like a bug in the code. A function that returned the wrong value. A node that didn't match the network protocol.

She reached their room and found Lio sitting on their bed, looking out the window. Their face was less drawn than it had been yesterday. Their eyes were clearer. They looked… rested.

"Rowan," Lio said, their voice soft. "Are you okay? You look… tired."

Rowan sat down beside them, her movements careful, her attention focused. "I'm fine. Just… tired."

Lio's face went still, recognition dawning. "You used empathy, didn't you?"

Rowan's throat closed.

They knew.

They could see it.

The aftermath. The cost. The price.

"Yes," she said, her voice soft. "I did."

Lio's face crumpled. "Rowan, you can't keep doing this. You can't keep paying this cost. It's going to kill you."

Her hands shook.

They were right.

She couldn't keep doing this.

She couldn't keep paying this cost.

It was going to kill her.

But she would do it again.

Because they were human.

Because they felt.

Because they connected.

And that mattered.

No matter the cost.

Even when it was unsustainable.

Even when it was wrong.

Her breath caught.

This was the empathy zone.

And she'd fallen into it.

Willingly.

Knowingly.

And she would do it again.

Because they were human.

Because they felt.

Because they connected.

And that mattered.

No matter the cost.
