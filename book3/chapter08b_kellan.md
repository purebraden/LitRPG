# Chapter 8B — Kellan's Perspective: The Efficiency

Kellan had always liked order.

Even before the System, before the world broke, before everything changed, he'd liked things organized. Efficient. Predictable. He'd liked systems that worked, processes that flowed, structures that made sense.

Harmony was all of that.

Kellan walked through the settlement, his steps measured, his attention focused. The streets were clean. The buildings were organized. The people moved with purpose, their paths efficient, their interactions smooth.

Everything worked.

Everything flowed.

Everything was efficient.

This was what he'd needed.

This was what he'd wanted.

This was what made sense.

Kellan had been struggling. He'd been fighting. He'd been resisting. And it had cost him. Not just physically—though the exhaustion was real—but emotionally. The weight of resistance, the cost of staying human, the price of connection.

It was inefficient.

It was wasteful.

It was wrong.

Harmony showed him a better way.

A way that worked.

A way that flowed.

A way that made sense.

Kellan watched people work, their movements coordinated, their interactions smooth. They helped each other. They shared resources. They worked together seamlessly.

No wasted motion.

No friction.

No variance.

Like a well-run operation, a system that had been optimized for maximum output.

This was what he'd needed.

This was what he'd wanted.

This was what made sense.

Kellan's overlay flickered.

```
STATUS: ALIGNMENT IN PROGRESS
EFFICIENCY: INCREASING
VARIANCE: DECREASING
RECOMMENDATION: CONTINUE OPTIMIZATION
```

Kellan nodded.

Efficiency.

Optimization.

Order.

This was what he'd needed.

This was what he'd wanted.

This was what made sense.

Rowan was suspicious.

Rowan thought something was wrong.

But Kellan couldn't see it.

What was wrong with efficiency?

What was wrong with optimization?

What was wrong with order?

Kellan had been fighting for weeks. Struggling for weeks. Resisting for weeks. And it had cost him. Not just physically—though the exhaustion was real—but emotionally. The weight of resistance, the cost of staying human, the price of connection.

It was inefficient.

It was wasteful.

It was wrong.

Harmony showed him a better way.

A way that worked.

A way that flowed.

A way that made sense.

Kellan's overlay flickered again.

```
NOTE: RESISTANCE INCREASES VARIANCE
RECOMMENDATION: ACCEPT OPTIMIZATION
```

Kellan nodded.

Resistance was inefficient.

Resistance was wasteful.

Resistance was wrong.

Harmony showed him a better way.

A way that worked.

A way that flowed.

A way that made sense.

Kellan walked to the workshop area, where people were building, repairing, creating. Their movements were coordinated. Their interactions were smooth. Their work was efficient.

No wasted motion.

No friction.

No variance.

Like a well-run operation, a system that had been optimized for maximum output.

Kellan watched a group of people working together on a project. They moved in sync, their actions coordinated, their communication efficient. They didn't need to talk much. They just… knew. They understood. They worked together seamlessly.

This was what he'd needed.

This was what he'd wanted.

This was what made sense.

Kellan's overlay flickered.

Kellan walked to the gardens, where people were tending plants, harvesting food, maintaining the settlement. Their movements were coordinated. Their interactions were smooth. Their work was efficient.

No wasted motion.

No friction.

No variance.

Like a well-run operation, a system that had been optimized for maximum output.

Kellan watched a person harvest vegetables, their movements methodical, their actions precise. They didn't waste anything. They didn't damage anything. They just… worked. Efficiently. Optimally. Perfectly.

This was what he'd needed.

This was what he'd wanted.

This was what made sense.

Kellan nodded.

Kellan walked to the common area, where people were eating, talking, resting. Their movements were coordinated. Their interactions were smooth. Their behavior was efficient.

No wasted motion.

No friction.

No variance.

Like a well-run operation, a system that had been optimized for maximum output.

Kellan watched people interact, their conversations brief, their connections efficient. They didn't waste time. They didn't waste energy. They just… were. Efficiently. Optimally. Perfectly.

This was what he'd needed.

This was what he'd wanted.

This was what made sense.

Kellan's overlay flickered.

Kellan nodded.
