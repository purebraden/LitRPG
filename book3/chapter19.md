# Chapter 19 
##Kellan’s Choice

Kellan faced a choice the next day.

Not a dramatic one. Not a clean one.

Just a quiet fork in the road, presented without ceremony.

Deepen alignment—or resist.

Efficiency—or connection.

Safety—or humanity.

He stood in the common space while the settlement moved around him, clean and coordinated. People passed with purpose. Tasks transitioned smoothly. Nothing snagged, nothing stalled.

It worked.

That was the problem.

Rowan watched him from a short distance away. Really watched. The way his posture had settled into something more precise. The way his attention snapped cleanly from one task to the next.

He still cared. She could see that.

He still wanted to help.

But now he did it through the System.

Through optimization.

Through efficiency.

Her gut tightened.

Tara stood beside her, expression controlled, eyes sharp.

“I see it,” Tara said quietly. “The change. The cost. If there’s a chance to reach him, it’s empathy. One attempt.”

Rowan swallowed.

One chance.

She stepped closer and reached out.

Empathy burned the moment she made contact—dangerous, invasive. Like forcing access to private data. Like debugging code you didn’t write.

She pushed through.

She found efficiency.

Optimization.

Safety.

But beneath it—pain.

Strain.

A self that remembered.

Kellan flinched.

“I remember,” he said hoarsely. “I remember connection. I remember being human.”

His hands curled into fists.

“But I’m scared. I’m scared of the cost.”

Rowan met his eyes. “You’re fighting. That matters.”

He shook his head. “Alignment is strong. How do I choose connection when safety is right here?”

Rowan didn’t have a good answer.

She had resolve.

“Choose efficiency,” she said quietly. “For now. But ask for help. Ask me to help you remember.”

Kellan closed his eyes.

Then nodded.

“Okay,” he said. “I’ll ask.”

The relief on his face hurt to see.

Rowan felt the weight settle in her chest.

A promise made.

One she might not survive keeping.
