# Chapter 7
## River's Choice

River had been resisting for six months.

Not in any way that felt brave anymore. Not loudly. Not cleanly. Just day after day of saying no with a body that no longer cooperated.

Six months of waking up already tired. Six months of pain that never quite settled, just shifted location. Six months of feeling like every connection—to people, to memory, to herself—required effort she no longer had.

She sat in the gardens with her hands folded tightly in her lap, fingers trembling despite the warmth. Her breathing came shallow and uneven, as if her chest had forgotten how to expand all the way.

The pain wasn’t just physical anymore.

It lived behind her eyes. In the hesitation before every decision. In the constant sense that she was falling behind some invisible standard everyone else understood.

River had watched people align.

She’d seen it happen gradually at first—shoulders lowering, movements smoothing out, faces losing their sharp edges. People who had once flinched now smiled easily. People who had struggled through tasks moved with practiced confidence.

They looked… lighter.

Not empty. Not hollow. Just relieved.

River told herself she was imagining it. That it was propaganda, confirmation bias, wishful thinking.

But the truth pressed closer every day.

Those people weren’t suffering anymore.

River wanted that.

She wanted to stop waking up braced for pain.
She wanted her thoughts to stop looping.
She wanted to stop feeling like resistance itself was eroding her.

She had tried. God, she had tried.

She had stayed human. Stayed connected. Stayed feeling. And the cost of that choice was written all over her body: the exhaustion that never lifted, the injuries that healed too slowly, the emotional rawness that left her exposed and brittle.

It wasn’t just hard.

It was unsustainable.

River looked around the gardens. Everything was orderly. People moved with quiet purpose, never colliding, never hesitating. Conversations were brief and efficient, punctuated by soft smiles.

Safe. Productive. Calm.

Everything River no longer was.

Her hands shook harder.

The clinic sat just beyond the garden path. Clean lines. Frosted glass. No alarms. No guards.

Just help.

She could go inside.

She could let someone take this weight for a while.

The thought settled over her like a blanket. Heavy, but warm.

She stood slowly, testing her balance before taking a step. Every movement felt deliberate, careful, as though her body might refuse if asked too much.

The clinic doors slid open without resistance.

Rowan’s face flickered through her mind—frustrated, worried, still fighting. Rowan had tried to explain. Tried to warn her. Tried to frame this as something more dangerous than it appeared.

River didn’t doubt Rowan’s intentions.

She doubted her own ability to keep going.

What was so wrong with peace?

What was so wrong with rest?

She’d given six months to resistance. Six months of pain in the name of something abstract and fragile.

She was tired of bleeding for principles she could barely articulate anymore.

At the clinic entrance, River stopped. Her hand hovered inches from the door handle, fingers stiff and numb.

This was the moment.

She could turn back.
She could keep struggling.
She could keep insisting that suffering meant something.

Or she could step forward.

Her hands trembled.

Six months was enough.

River opened the door.

Inside, the clinic was quiet in a way that felt intentional. No sharp smells. No harsh lights. Chairs lined the walls, occupied by people at different stages of relief—some tense, some weary, some already softened into something closer to calm.

No one looked afraid.

A woman emerged from one of the rooms, her expression serene, her posture relaxed. Whatever pain she’d carried before no longer showed on her face.

River swallowed.

She sat and waited, fingers curling into the fabric of her clothes, breath catching and releasing in short bursts.

She told herself this was help.
She told herself this was care.

“River?”

She looked up.

Dr. Chen stood in the doorway, her expression gentle, unhurried. She didn’t smile too widely. Didn’t rush her. Just waited, as if there were no alternative outcomes worth considering.

“Come with me,” she said.

The room was immaculate. A single chair sat at the center. No restraints. No screens.

Just space.

“Sit,” Dr. Chen said softly. “We’ll take this step together.”

River lowered herself into the chair. Her hands shook openly now.

Dr. Chen settled across from her, posture relaxed, voice calm.

“What do you need?” she asked.

The question cracked something open.

River’s throat tightened.

“I just…” Her voice came out smaller than she expected. “I just want it to stop hurting.”

Dr. Chen nodded, as if this were the most reasonable request in the world.

“Then we can begin.”

Warmth spread first—gentle, deliberate. The tension in River’s shoulders loosened without permission. Her breathing evened out.

The noise inside her head softened.

The fear didn’t vanish. It just stopped demanding answers.

River let herself rest in that quiet.

For the first time in months, her body wasn’t arguing with her.

This—this was what she had been chasing.

Safety.
Rest.
Peace.

It felt like enough.

For now.

River closed her eyes and allowed the warmth to hold.

She stopped fighting.

And for the moment, the world stopped asking her to.
