# Chapter 6
## Social Penalties

The next corridor was narrower, and the air smelled faintly of smoke.

Rowan’s ankle held, but she could feel the brace biting into her skin. Every step was a negotiation between pain and function.

Lio stayed close enough that Rowan could hear them breathe. It was uneven. Shallow. Like their body was still waiting for permission to fail.

Rowan hated that.

They rounded another curve and the corridor opened into a wider space that could have been mistaken for a small plaza—if plazas were underground and built from glowing stone.

People were there.

Not many. A handful. Maybe eight or nine figures clustered around a central feature that looked like a fountain carved from the same dark stone, filled with water that glowed faintly rather than reflecting.

They were dressed in mismatched clothing—some modern, some not. Jeans beside roughspun fabric. A hoodie beside a leather jerkin. The kind of visual incoherence you got when the world stole from multiple sources.

Rowan slowed instinctively.

Lio’s breath hitched. “There are… people.”

Rowan's gaze swept the group. No one was smiling. No one looked relaxed. They looked like survivors who'd learned that hope had a price. Like the networking event from hell, where everyone was sizing each other up but no one actually wanted to connect. Or an all-hands meeting where the CEO announced layoffs and everyone pretended it was "strategic restructuring."

One of them—a tall woman with cropped hair and a scar across her cheek—noticed Rowan and Lio and straightened.

Her eyes went immediately to Rowan’s face.

Not her injuries. Not her limp.

Her face.

Rowan’s skin prickled.

The woman spoke first. “You’re new.”

Rowan kept her hands visible. “Yes.”

The woman’s gaze sharpened. “And you made it through the first door.”

Rowan nodded once.

A murmur rippled through the group, low and cautious.

Lio moved closer to Rowan’s side, almost hiding behind her.

Rowan didn’t blame them.

The scarred woman took one step forward and then stopped, as if she’d reached an invisible boundary. She studied Rowan like she was reading a sign.

“What’s your Path?” the woman asked.

Rowan’s mouth tightened. “I don’t know what counts as safe information here.”

The woman’s eyes flicked to Lio. “What’s theirs?”

Lio flinched, shoulders hunching. “I— I don’t—”

Rowan cut in. “We’re together.”

The woman’s expression shifted, subtle but real—like something in her had been confirmed.

A new line appeared in Rowan’s vision, quiet and unwelcome.

REPUTATION SHIFT: NEGATIVE
SOURCE: LOCAL COHORT
REASON: UNOPTIMIZED COHESION

Rowan stared at it.

Local cohort. Reputation.

She felt something like cold fury rise up, not because of the penalty itself, but because of the casual way the system framed human relationships as optimization errors.

Rowan lifted her gaze to the group again.

The scarred woman’s mouth twisted. “You’re one of those.”

Rowan blinked. “One of what?”

The woman’s eyes hardened. “The ones who try to save everyone.”

Rowan kept her face neutral with effort. “Is that supposed to be an insult?”

A man behind the woman—thin, gaunt, with a nervous twitch—laughed once, bitter. “It is if you want to live.”

Lio made a small sound, like a hurt animal.

Rowan’s jaw tightened. “You don’t know us.”

The scarred woman shrugged. “We know the pattern. People show up. The system offers choices. Some of them learn quickly.”

Rowan felt the tug in her attention intensify, pushing her toward the fountain, toward the center of the group, toward whatever counted as progress in the system’s eyes.

Rowan ignored it.

“What happens if you don’t learn quickly?” Rowan asked.

The scarred woman’s gaze went distant for a moment, as if she’d seen something and didn’t want to revisit it.

“You stagnate,” she said.

Rowan almost laughed. “That’s the exact failure condition phrasing, yes.”

The woman looked startled. “You can see it.”

It wasn’t a question.

Rowan’s skin went cold.

The group’s posture shifted collectively—subtle, predatory interest mixing with fear.

Lio’s hand found Rowan’s sleeve and gripped.

Rowan kept her face still.

The scarred woman’s voice dropped. “If you can see it, then you’re—”

“Visible,” Rowan said sharply.

The scarred woman flinched, then exhaled. “Right. Visible.”

She tilted her head. “That’s rare.”

Rowan’s stomach sank.

Rare meant valuable. Valuable meant targeted.

Rowan forced her voice into calm. “What is this place?”

The scarred woman gestured vaguely around them. “A node. A rest area. A gathering point. It’s… safe, mostly.”

“Mostly,” Rowan repeated.

The man behind her snorted. “Safe if you don’t cause problems.”

Rowan’s eyes narrowed. “Define problems.”

The scarred woman’s gaze held Rowan’s. “Deviation.”

Rowan almost smiled. Almost.

So that was it.

A survivor community shaped by the system’s punishments until self-policing became survival.

Rowan looked at the fountain. People stood near it, dipping cups, washing hands. 

A young woman with short-cropped hair and a bandaged arm caught Rowan's eye—Mira, someone would call her later, if names mattered here. She stood slightly apart from the others, watching with sharp eyes. A teenager with a split lip—Marcus—leaned against the wall, looking exhausted. A mother and daughter—Sarah and Emma—sat together, the daughter maybe ten, staring at her feet with blank resignation. An older man with a limp—Gregory—dipped a cup into the fountain with careful precision. A man with haunted eyes—David—stood alone, lost in thought. Siblings, maybe late teens—Alex and Sam—stayed close together, never leaving each other's side.

Rowan felt something twist inside her chest.

"You have kids here," Rowan said quietly.

The scarred woman’s gaze flicked to the girl. “We have whoever survives long enough to reach this point.”

Rowan’s voice went flat. “And you teach them to optimize.”

The scarred woman’s eyes hardened. “We teach them to live.”

Rowan almost said: Those are not the same thing.

She didn’t. She could see how fragile this group was—how much they’d sacrificed to feel like they had control.

Rowan took a slow breath.

“Name,” she said, changing the subject. “You first.”

The scarred woman hesitated, then said, “Sable.”

Rowan suspected that wasn’t her Earth name.

It didn’t matter. Names were sometimes armor.

Rowan nodded. “Rowan. This is Lio.”

Lio barely managed a nod.

Sable’s gaze slid over Lio with a kind of practiced detachment. “You’re injured.”

Lio flinched. “I’m— I’m fine.”

Sable’s mouth twitched. “No, you’re not. But you’re alive.”

Rowan watched her closely. “Do you have medical supplies?”

Sable hesitated. “We have resources. Limited.”

Rowan glanced at the fountain again. “You have water.”

Sable’s eyes narrowed. “Water is… provided.”

Rowan understood immediately.

Provided meant controlled.

Rowan’s vision flickered with a new notification.

ACCESS RESTRICTED: STABILITY NODE
CONDITION: LOCAL COHORT ACCEPTANCE
STATUS: DENIED

Rowan’s pulse thudded.

The system had just blocked her from claiming the Stability Credit because of reputation.

It wasn’t punishing her directly.

It was turning the community into the enforcement layer.

Rowan’s mouth went tight. She looked at Sable. “You’re gatekeeping access.”

Sable’s eyes hardened. “We’re managing risk.”

Rowan’s voice stayed calm by force. “Risk of what?”

Sable’s gaze flicked toward the corridor behind Rowan—the direction they’d come from. “The system doesn’t like noise.”

Rowan almost laughed again. “Of course it doesn’t.”

A younger man stepped forward from the group—broad shouldered, with a bandage around his head. His eyes were tired but clear.

He looked at Rowan and then at Lio.

Then he looked at Sable.

“Let them drink,” he said.

Sable’s jaw tightened. “No.”

The man’s expression didn’t change. “They’ll die if we don’t.”

Sable’s voice sharpened. “Or they’ll bring correction down on us.”

Rowan watched the exchange and felt something unpleasant settle in her stomach.

This wasn’t just fear. It was learned behavior. Reinforced punishment.

Rowan’s overlay flashed briefly.

CORRECTIVE INFLUENCE: STIRRING (LOCAL)
NOTE: SOCIAL INSTABILITY DETECTED

Rowan stared.

The system was monitoring the conversation.

Rowan lifted her gaze to Sable, then to the man who’d spoken.

Rowan chose her next words carefully, like she was deploying a fix to a fragile production environment.

“I’m not here to destabilize you,” Rowan said evenly. “I’m here to survive.”

Sable’s eyes narrowed. “Then do what works.”

Rowan’s voice went cold. “You mean abandon my companion.”

Sable didn’t deny it. She didn’t have to.

Lio’s grip on Rowan’s sleeve tightened until it hurt.

Rowan looked down at Lio, then back at the group.

She felt the system’s tug like a gentle pressure, suggesting the simplest route.

Leave Lio. Improve probability. Get access. Move on.

Rowan’s stomach turned.

She'd seen this logic before in different forms: layoffs framed as optimization, harmful policies justified by metrics, people turned into cost centers. The all-hands meeting where they'd announced "headcount optimization" and three teams disappeared overnight. The manager who'd justified cutting benefits by pointing to quarterly projections. The board that treated human beings like variables in a spreadsheet.

It was still wrong.

Rowan lifted her chin.

“No,” she said.

The word landed like a stone.

Sable’s expression went flat. “Then you don’t get the node.”

Rowan nodded once. “Okay.”

The broad-shouldered man swore softly. “Sable—”

Sable cut him off with a glance.

Rowan turned to Lio. “We’re leaving.”

Lio’s eyes went wide. “But— the water—”

Rowan’s voice softened slightly. “We’ll find another way.”

Rowan began to guide Lio back toward the corridor.

Behind them, the group’s murmurs shifted—some relieved, some angry, some fearful.

Rowan felt the social penalty settle like dust.

And the system—polite as ever—added another line to her vision as if it were noting a ticket.

REPUTATION SHIFT: NEGATIVE
SEVERITY: MODERATE
EFFECT: RESOURCE ACCESS LIMITED

Rowan’s jaw clenched.

“Of course,” she whispered.

They reached the corridor mouth.

The broad-shouldered man stepped after them, ignoring Sable’s sharp intake of breath.

“Wait,” he said, voice low.

Rowan stopped and turned, keeping herself between him and Lio.

He raised his hands. “I’m not here to hurt you.”

Rowan’s gaze stayed steady. “Then what are you here for?”

He glanced back at the node, then at Rowan again. His eyes flicked briefly to a point near Rowan’s shoulder—close, but not tracking text.

He couldn’t see the overlay.

But he could see the change it caused in people’s posture.

“I’m here,” he said quietly, “because Sable is wrong.”

Rowan studied him.

“Name,” Rowan said.

He hesitated, then said, “Kellan.”

Rowan didn’t trust it any more than she’d trusted Sable’s, but it was something.

Kellan’s voice dropped further. “There’s a storage alcove down the next corridor. The system doesn’t always track what’s left there. Sometimes… supplies ‘go missing.’”

Rowan’s mouth tightened. “And you’re telling me this because…?”

Kellan’s gaze flicked to Lio. Something like regret passed across his face.

“Because I left someone once,” he said quietly. “And I’ve regretted it every day since.”

Rowan held his gaze.

The system tugged harder now, as if suggesting she ignore him, keep moving, avoid entanglement.

Rowan forced herself to breathe.

This was the test.

Not the dungeon. Not the door.

The social layer.

Rowan nodded once. “Show me.”

Kellan exhaled like he’d been holding his breath for hours.

Sable’s voice snapped from behind him. “Kellan!”

He didn’t turn. “I’m done optimizing.”

Rowan felt a chill.

Because Kellan wasn’t just deviating.

He was choosing.

And choices—real ones—were the system’s enemy.
