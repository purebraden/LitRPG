# Chapter 14
## Aftermath

Kellan didn’t wake screaming.

That worried Rowan more than if he had.

He lay on his side where she’d eased him down, eyes open but unfocused, staring at the stone like it might eventually explain itself. His breathing was shallow, uneven, as if each inhale had to be negotiated.

Rowan stayed close, one hand wrapped around his wrist, fingers pressed lightly to his pulse. It was there. Weak, but steady.

Alive.

Not okay.

Lio hovered a few steps away, knees pulled to their chest, arms wrapped tight around themselves. They looked smaller somehow, like the pressure had hollowed something out and left less behind.

The corridor was quiet.

Too quiet.

No system messages. No follow-up notes. Just absence.

Rowan hated that most of all.

She shifted carefully, ignoring the protest from her ankle, and leaned closer to Kellan. “Hey,” she said softly. “Can you hear me?”

His eyes flickered.

That was all.

Rowan swallowed. “That’s fine. You don’t have to talk.”

She didn’t know if that was true, but it felt important to say.

Minutes passed. Or maybe longer. Time felt unreliable now, stretched thin by exhaustion and shock.

Lio finally spoke, voice barely audible. “Is he… gone?”

Rowan shook her head immediately. “No.”

Lio nodded, like they’d expected that answer but needed it anyway. “He feels… different.”

Rowan closed her eyes for a second.

“Yes,” she said. “He is.”

She hated how certain she was.

Rowan’s overlay flickered at the edge of her vision, hesitant this time. Like the system wasn’t sure it wanted to be seen.

Rowan looked at the words, then deliberately looked away.

“No,” she murmured. “You don’t get to audit this.”

Lio’s head lifted. “What?”

“Nothing,” Rowan said. “Just… talking to the walls.”

She shifted her grip on Kellan’s wrist and felt a faint twitch beneath her fingers. Not muscle memory. Something deeper. Like a reflex deciding whether it was worth the effort.

Rowan leaned back against the stone and let her head rest there for a moment.

The weight hit her then.

Not the system’s pressure. That had eased, for now.

This was heavier.

This was the aftermath.

Rowan thought of Earth—of the quiet hours after an incident was "resolved," when the alerts stopped but the damage remained. When people walked around stunned, replaying decisions, wondering which branch had led them here. The postmortem meeting where they'd spent six hours documenting root causes and mitigation steps, but no one had mentioned the human cost. The junior engineer who'd quit. The sleep lost. The trust eroded. Kellan was the cost. The human cost. The part that most systems tried to ignore.

She'd always hated postmortems that rushed past that part.

Kellan’s fingers curled suddenly, weak but intentional, catching against her sleeve.

Rowan straightened instantly. “Kellan?”

His brow furrowed. His lips moved.

Rowan leaned closer, heart pounding. “I’m here.”

“…too loud,” he whispered.

The words were slurred, barely formed, but they landed like a blow.

Rowan inhaled slowly. “I know.”

She didn’t ask what was loud. She didn’t need to.

The system had turned the world up inside him and walked away.

Lio crawled closer, stopping just short of touching him. “Kellan?”

His eyes shifted toward the sound of their voice. Focused, briefly. Then drifted again.

Rowan watched it happen and felt something sharp twist in her chest.

This was the price.

Not death. Not martyrdom.

Damage.

The kind that didn’t show up in statistics.

Rowan’s overlay flickered again.

Rowan laughed quietly, humorless. “You think?”

She reached up and scrubbed a hand over her face, smearing dirt and blood across her skin. Her hands were shaking now. She hadn’t let herself feel it before.

Lio noticed. “Rowan… was it my fault?”

Rowan’s head snapped up. “No.”

The word came out sharper than she intended.

She softened her voice immediately. “No. It wasn’t yours. It wasn’t his. And it wasn’t mine, either.”

Lio frowned, confused. “But you chose—”

“I chose people,” Rowan said. “That part I don’t regret.”

She met Lio’s eyes. “What the system did with that choice is on the system.”

Lio’s shoulders trembled. “Then why does it hurt so much?”

Rowan didn’t answer right away.

Because that’s how it works.
Because pain is cheaper than compliance.
Because harm teaches faster than explanations.

She kept those thoughts to herself.

Instead, she said, “Because you’re not numb.”

Lio blinked, tears spilling over. “I don’t want to be numb.”

Rowan shook her head. “Good.”

She shifted again, carefully repositioning Kellan so his head rested more comfortably against her thigh. He didn’t resist. Didn’t react.

Rowan felt something inside her settle into a hard, cold shape.

Resolve.

She looked down at Kellan’s face, at the slackness there, and made herself a promise she didn’t say out loud.

The system could take her comfort.
It could take her safety.
It could even take her future.

But it would not get her consent.

Rowan closed her eyes briefly, then opened them and scanned the corridor ahead.

“We can’t stay here,” she said quietly.

Lio sniffed. “Where do we go?”

Rowan exhaled. “Somewhere the system isn’t expecting us to stop.”

She shifted her weight, bracing to stand, pain flaring sharp and bright. She welcomed it. Pain meant she could still act.

As she stood, her overlay appeared one last time.

Not a command.

Not a warning.

Just information.

Rowan met the empty air with a tired, dangerous smile.

“Yeah,” she murmured. “I do.”

She helped Lio to their feet, then steadied Kellan between them.

They moved on.

Slower now.

Heavier.

But together.

They didn't get far.

Kellan's steps grew unsteady after only a few minutes. His breathing hitched. His weight sagged against Rowan's side, and she realized they couldn't keep going like this. Not when he needed rest. Not when he needed time to process what the system had done.

They found an alcove—a narrow recess in the corridor wall, barely deep enough to qualify as shelter, but enough to get out of the main passage. Enough to hide, temporarily, from whatever might come looking.

Rowan eased Kellan down carefully, positioning him against the stone wall. Lio hovered close, their expression worried.

"We're staying here?" Lio asked quietly.

Rowan nodded, scanning the corridor behind them. Empty. Quiet. For now. "Just for a little while. Until he can walk properly. Until we can move without—"

She didn't finish the thought.

Until we can move without him collapsing.
Until we can move without me worrying he'll break.
Until we can move without the system noticing we're vulnerable.

"We'll rest," Rowan said instead. "Just rest. For now."

Lio settled down beside Kellan, their small frame protective, their presence steadying.

Rowan took up position near the alcove's entrance, watching, waiting, making sure they were safe.

They'd rest.

They'd heal.

They'd survive.

Together.
