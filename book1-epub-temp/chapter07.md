# Chapter 7
## System Debt

They moved quickly.

Rowan kept her pace controlled, refusing to let urgency turn into sloppiness. Kellan led them down a side corridor that branched off the node like an afterthought. The glow-veins here were dimmer, less curated. The stone felt older.

The corridor narrowed and then opened into a shallow alcove barely large enough for three people to stand without touching. A pile of crates sat in the corner—rough wood bound with metal straps—half covered by a tarp.

Rowan’s eyes narrowed.

This did not look like a place meant to be found.

Kellan crouched and lifted the tarp. Beneath it were supplies: cloth bandages, a small tin of something that smelled medicinal even from a distance, and a waterskin that looked like it had been patched twice.

Rowan didn’t touch anything yet.

She looked at her overlay.

PATH: THE STAIR THAT DOES NOT END
STATUS: COMPLETE
REWARD: STABILITY CREDIT (MINOR) — UNCLAIMED
ACCESS: RESTRICTED (LOCAL COHORT)

And then a new entry beneath it—quiet, like a ledger update.

DEBT: DEVIATION (SOCIAL COHESION)
CURRENT LOAD: 2

Rowan’s stomach dropped.

She stared at CURRENT LOAD: 2.

She hadn’t seen “debt” before.

She didn’t like that she was seeing it now.

Rowan inhaled slowly, forcing her brain into analysis.

Debt implied accumulation.
Accumulation implied thresholds.
Thresholds implied consequences.

Rowan looked up at Kellan.

He was watching her face. “You see something.”

Rowan hesitated, then nodded. “Yes.”

Lio hugged themselves, eyes darting. “Is it… bad?”

Rowan forced her voice into calm. “It’s… information.”

Which was true. Information was never inherently bad.

What systems did with it was.

Rowan looked back at the supplies. Lio’s lips were cracked. Their skin had the dull pallor of dehydration. Rowan could feel her own head swimming slightly, that subtle dizziness that came when the body began to prioritize organs and everything else became optional.

They needed water.

Rowan reached for the waterskin.

The moment her fingers brushed it, her overlay flickered.

DEBT: DEVIATION (RESOURCE ACQUISITION)
NOTE: UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS
CURRENT LOAD: 3

Rowan froze.

She hadn’t even taken it yet.

The system was counting intent.

Rowan’s grip tightened.

Kellan’s voice was low. “What is it?”

Rowan stared at the waterskin and felt anger rise like heat.

“It’s keeping score,” Rowan said.

Lio’s voice shook. “Of course it is.”

Rowan swallowed.

Because that was the real horror: how quickly Lio accepted it.

How normal the abuse had already become.

Rowan forced herself to let go of the waterskin and looked at her overlay again.

DEBT: 3.

She didn’t know what that meant, but she could guess.

A system that tracked debt applied interest.

Rowan exhaled slowly.

“Okay,” she said. “We’re going to do this carefully.”

She looked at Kellan. “When you take supplies from here, what happens?”

Kellan’s jaw tightened. “Sometimes nothing. Sometimes… people get sick. Or the corridor shifts. Or the node gets ‘unfriendly.’”

Rowan’s eyes narrowed. “So you can’t link cause and effect reliably.”

Kellan gave a bitter laugh. “Welcome.”

Rowan nodded grimly. “Okay. Then we treat it like a non-deterministic failure in a distributed system.”

Lio blinked at her. “A what?”

Rowan softened her voice. “We can’t predict exactly what triggers punishment. But we can track patterns and reduce risk.”

She looked at the waterskin again.

“We need water,” Rowan said. “We also need to understand what happens when we ‘owe’ the system.”

Rowan reached into her pocket and pulled out the scrap of creature membrane—what little remained after reinforcing their wraps.

She placed it on the ground between them, deliberately.

Then she lifted her foot—careful with the ankle—and stepped on it.

Her overlay flickered.

DEBT: DEVIATION (ENVIRONMENTAL DISRESPECT)
CURRENT LOAD: 4

Rowan went very still.

Kellan stared. “You just—”

“Confirmed,” Rowan said, voice tight. “It logs symbolic actions.”

Lio’s eyes widened, horrified. “Why would you do that?”

Rowan looked at Lio. “Because if it logs symbolic actions, it’s not just measuring survival. It’s measuring compliance.”

She lifted her foot off the membrane.

Nothing changed.

Rowan’s heart thudded.

No immediate punishment.

Either punishment was delayed, or the system escalated when debt hit a threshold, or it applied pressure through humans.

Rowan looked at Kellan and felt the weight of what he’d done by guiding them here.

He’d deviated too.

His debt, if he had one, was likely higher.

Rowan’s overlay updated again—quiet, like a knife sliding from a sheath.

CORRECTIVE INFLUENCE: STIRRING
SCOPE: LOCAL
LIKELIHOOD OF EVENT: 41%

Rowan’s pulse quickened.

She didn’t know what an “event” meant here, but she knew the system’s language was always sanitized.

Event meant punishment.

Rowan looked at the waterskin again and made a decision.

She picked it up.

The overlay updated immediately.

DEBT: DEVIATION (RESOURCE ACQUISITION)
CURRENT LOAD: 5
NOTE: INTEREST APPLIES AT THRESHOLD

Rowan’s stomach tightened.

There it was.

Interest.

Rowan swallowed. “Okay.”

She handed the waterskin to Lio. “Drink. Small sips.”

Lio’s hands shook as they took it. They uncapped it and drank too quickly, then coughed.

Rowan steadied them with one hand. “Slow. Please.”

Lio nodded, eyes squeezed shut. They drank again, slower this time.

Rowan turned to Kellan.

“Take bandages,” Rowan said. “And whatever that is.” She nodded at the tin.

Kellan hesitated. “That’ll—”

“I know,” Rowan cut in. “But we’re already in it.”

Kellan’s jaw tightened. He reached for the tin and bandages.

Rowan’s overlay flickered again as he touched them.

DEBT: DEVIATION (SOCIAL COHESION)
CURRENT LOAD: 6

Rowan’s mouth went dry.

Their debt was shared now.

The system was grouping them.

A cohort.

Rowan almost laughed. Of course. A distributed problem needed a distributed enforcement model.

Rowan watched Kellan tuck the supplies into his jacket.

Kellan glanced up. “You look like you’re about to bite through stone.”

Rowan forced a smile that wasn’t one. “I’m just… calculating.”

Lio wiped their mouth and looked at Rowan with something like fragile hope.

“Does it… go away?” Lio asked.

Rowan looked at the overlay.

No hint of repayment. No instructions. No ledger entries labeled "forgiveness."

Like a credit score that only goes down. Or technical debt that compounds until every deploy becomes a risk. The teams that had let their codebase accumulate debt until every change required three days of untangling dependencies. This felt the same. Only the currency was different.

Rowan's voice went very calm. "I don't know."

Lio’s face crumpled.

Rowan stepped closer and put a hand lightly on Lio’s shoulder.

“But I do know this,” Rowan said. “If it can track debt, it can also be made to show it. Which means it can be made to expose its rules.”

Kellan stared at her. “You think you can… hack it.”

Rowan looked at the faint glow-veins in the wall, at the way the stone seemed to breathe, at the polite bureaucracy of a system that treated human beings as inputs.

Rowan’s eyes narrowed. “I think it has edge cases.”

The overlay flickered again.

LIKELIHOOD OF EVENT: 52%

Rowan’s pulse jumped.

She looked back toward the corridor leading to the node.

“We need to move,” Rowan said.

Kellan’s expression tightened. “Back there?”

Rowan shook her head. “Not to the node. Away from it.”

She turned to Lio. “Can you walk?”

Lio swallowed and nodded. “I think so.”

Rowan nodded sharply. “Good. Then we go now.”

As they stepped out of the alcove, Rowan felt the pressure in the air change—subtle, like a thermostat adjustment.

The glow-veins dimmed behind them.

Ahead, the corridor brightened like a runway.

And Rowan’s overlay updated with a final line, quiet and unmistakable.

DEBT THRESHOLD: APPROACHING
NOTE: CORRECTION WILL IMPROVE EFFICIENCY

Rowan’s hands curled into fists.

“Of course,” she whispered. “You call harm ‘efficiency.’”

Lio looked at her, eyes wide. “What?”

Rowan forced her voice steady. “Nothing. Just… keep moving.”

Because whatever the system was about to do, Rowan could feel it coiling.

And she had a sinking suspicion it was going to use the easiest lever it had.

People.
