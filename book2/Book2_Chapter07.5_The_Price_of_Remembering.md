# Book 2 — Chapter 7.5: The Price of Remembering

They found him in a small workshop, tucked away in a side street that felt older, rougher, less finished than the rest of the city.

Gregory.

The older man with the limp, dipping a cup into the fountain with careful precision.

Except now he wasn't at a fountain. He was at a workbench, his hands moving over tools with that same careful precision. His limp was still there, but he moved around it, adapted to it, worked with it.

Rowan stopped at the doorway, watching.

Gregory didn't look up. He just kept working, his movements methodical, practiced, almost mechanical.

But not quite.

There was something in the way he paused, in the way he hesitated, in the way he looked at his work with something that wasn't quite approval, wasn't quite satisfaction.

It was recognition.

Rowan's pulse quickened.

"Gregory," she said quietly.

Gregory's hands stilled. He didn't look up, but his shoulders tensed. "I don't know that name."

Rowan stepped into the workshop. "From Sable's camp. You were there. You had a limp. You dipped water from the fountain."

Gregory's hands clenched around a tool. "I don't recall."

"Try," Rowan said. "Please. Try to remember."

Gregory's head lifted, just slightly. His eyes met hers, and for a heartbeat, there was something—pain, fear, recognition—before it faded.

"I remember arriving in the city," Gregory said, his voice even, measured. "I remember finding work. I remember settling here. I don't recall a camp."

Rowan's chest tightened. "What about the limp? What about the fountain? What about Sable?"

Gregory's expression didn't change. "I've always had the limp. I've always worked here. I've always been in the city."

Rowan looked at the workshop, at the tools, at the careful way Gregory moved. "How long have you been here?"

Gregory's hands resumed their work. "As long as I can remember."

"And before that?"

Gregory's movements slowed. "There was no before. I've always been here."

Rowan's stomach twisted.

I've always been here.

That wasn't true.

But Gregory believed it.

Or he remembered it differently.

Or the System had made him forget.

Rowan stepped closer. "Gregory, please. Try to remember. We were there together. You had a limp. You dipped water from the fountain. You were careful. You were precise. You were—"

Gregory's tool slipped, clattering against the workbench.

He froze.

For a second, his expression cracked—pain, fear, recognition—before smoothing back into place.

"I'm sorry," Gregory said, his voice quiet. "I don't recall. But if you need work done, I can help. I'm skilled. I'm efficient. I'm—"

"Optimized," Rowan finished.

Gregory's expression didn't change. "Yes. I'm optimized."

Rowan's vision swam.

I'm optimized.

That wasn't Gregory talking.

That was the System.

Speaking through him.

Not fully. Not completely. Just enough to redirect. Just enough to normalize. Just enough to erase.

Rowan looked at Gregory's limp, at the careful way he moved, at the empty way he looked.

He'd been corrected.

And he didn't remember.

Or he remembered, but it didn't matter.

Because the correction had worked.

Rowan's throat tightened. "Gregory, do you remember the camp? Do you remember Sable? Do you remember the fountain? Do you remember—"

Gregory's hands stilled again. "I remember arriving in the city. I remember finding work. I remember settling here. I don't recall a camp."

"But you do," Rowan said. "Somewhere. Deep down. You remember. You just can't access it. The System has—"

Gregory's head snapped up. "Don't."

Rowan stopped.

Gregory's expression was tight, pained. "Don't make me remember. Don't make me feel. Don't make me—"

"Remember what you lost?" Rowan asked.

Gregory's hands shook. "I haven't lost anything. I'm here. I'm working. I'm functional. I'm—"

"Empty," Rowan finished.

Gregory's expression cracked. "I'm not empty. I'm optimized. I'm efficient. I'm—"

"Gone," Rowan said.

Gregory's breath hitched. "I'm not gone. I'm here. I'm working. I'm—"

"Not you," Rowan said. "Not the person you were. Not the person who remembered the camp, who remembered Sable, who remembered the fountain. That person is gone. You're just—"

"Functional," Gregory finished, his voice quiet. "I'm functional."

Rowan's chest tightened.

Functional.

But not human.

Not the person he'd been.

Just functional.

Rowan looked at Gregory's limp, at the careful way he moved, at the empty way he looked.

He'd been corrected.

And he didn't remember.

Or he remembered, but it didn't matter.

Because the correction had worked.

Rowan stepped back. "I'm sorry."

Gregory's expression didn't change. "For what?"

"For making you remember. For making you feel. For making you—"

"Remember what I lost?" Gregory asked.

Rowan didn't answer.

Gregory's hands resumed their work, moving with that careful, optimized efficiency. "I haven't lost anything. I'm here. I'm working. I'm functional. I'm—"

"Optimized," Rowan finished.

Gregory didn't answer.

He just kept working, moving with that careful, optimized efficiency.

Gone.

But not dead.

Just erased.

Rowan turned away, feeling the weight of it press down.

Gregory was gone.

Not dead.

Just erased.

The person he'd been was gone, replaced by something that looked like him, moved like him, but wasn't him.

Rowan's vision swam.

"Rowan," Lio said gently. "We should go."

Rowan didn't move. She just watched Gregory work, moving with that careful, optimized efficiency.

The city had taken him.

Not by force. Not by violence.

By making him forget.

By making him remember differently.

By making him believe he'd always been here, always been this way, always been optimized.

Rowan's stomach twisted.

"Rowan," Kellan said. "We need to move."

Rowan looked at him, at the way he was watching Gregory, at the way he understood what had happened.

"He's gone," Rowan said.

Kellan's expression didn't change. "He's functional. He's safe. He's optimized."

"And he's gone," Rowan said again.

Kellan didn't answer.

They kept walking, moving away from the workshop, staying in the shadows. The city continued around them, normal and safe and wrong.

And somewhere behind them, Gregory worked with careful, optimized efficiency.

Gone.

But not dead.

Just erased.

Rowan's chest tightened.

The city was taking them.

One by one.

Making them forget.

Making them remember differently.

Making them believe they'd always been here, always been this way, always been optimized.

And they would be gone.

Not dead.

Just erased.

Rowan looked ahead, at the uncertain streets, at the people moving through them with careful, optimized efficiency.

The city was taking them.

And there was nothing she could do to stop it.

Nothing except remember.

Remember who they were.

Remember what they'd lost.

Remember that they were gone.

Not dead.

Just erased.

And that was worse.

Rowan looked back once, just before they turned the corner.

Gregory was gone.

Lost in his workshop.

Working with careful, optimized efficiency.

Gone.

But not dead.

Just erased.

And Rowan would remember.

Even if Gregory didn't.

Even if the city made him forget.

Even if the System made him remember differently.

Rowan would remember.

And that would have to be enough.

For now.

For always.
