# Chapter 18: The Cost of Remembering

They found a space between two buildings, a narrow gap where the city's structure didn't quite meet. Not shelter. Not safe. Just a pause. Just a moment to breathe.

Rowan sat on the floor, back against the wall, and tried to breathe through the aftermath. The ripple was still spreading. The city was still remembering. The corrected people were still desynchronizing.

And remembering hurt.

Lio sat beside her, hand on her shoulder, steady and present. Tara crouched nearby, knees drawn up, hands wrapped around her shins. Her eyes were wide, frightened, but she wasn't shaking anymore.

Kellan stood at the edge of the gap, watching the street through the narrow opening between buildings. His posture was efficient, his attention distributed evenly. But something was different. Something was wrong.

He wasn't just watching.

He was calculating.

Rowan's stomach twisted.

"Rowan," Lio said quietly. "How are you?"

Rowan didn't answer right away. She looked at the others, at the way they were all carrying something. At the way they were all processing what had happened.

The ripple.

The cascade.

The remembering.

"I don't know," Rowan said at last. "I feel… responsible."

"You are," Kellan said, not looking away from the opening. "You caused the ripple. You spread the empathy. You made the city remember itself."

The words hit like a physical blow.

Rowan's breath caught.

"Kellan," Lio said, his voice tight.

"No," Kellan said. "She needs to hear this. She needs to understand what she did."

Rowan's vision swam. "I know what I did."

"Do you?" Kellan asked, finally turning toward her. "Do you understand that you woke things the System put to sleep? Do you understand that you made corrected people remember? Do you understand that remembering hurts?"

Rowan's throat tightened. "I know."

"Do you?" Kellan asked again. "Because I don't think you do. I don't think you understand that correction was a kindness. That forgetting was a mercy. That remembering—"

"Is pain," Tara said quietly.

Kellan's head snapped toward her.

Tara's eyes were bright with tears. "Remembering is pain. I know. I've been remembering. I've been feeling. I've been—"

She stopped, breath hitching.

"Remembering hurts," Tara said. "But it's better than being empty."

Kellan's expression cracked. "Is it?"

"Yes," Lio said. "It is. Because being empty isn't living. It's just existing. And existing isn't enough."

Kellan's hands clenched. "But remembering hurts. And the System will make it stop. And when it does—"

"It'll be harder to wake them again," Rowan finished.

Kellan's expression grew pained. "So you've made it worse. You've made them remember, and feel, and grieve, and then the System will correct them again. And this time, it'll be permanent."

Rowan's chest tightened. "Maybe."

"Maybe?" Kellan asked. "You don't know?"

"I don't," Rowan said. "But I know that some of them are recovering. Slowly. Painfully. But they're recovering."

"Some of them," Kellan said. "Not all of them."

"No," Rowan said. "Not all of them."

The words hung in the air between them.

Not all of them.

Some would remember, and feel, and grieve, and then the System would correct them again.

And this time, it would be permanent.

Rowan's stomach twisted.

She'd done this.

She'd caused the ripple.

She'd spread the empathy.

She'd made the city remember itself.

And remembering hurt.

"Rowan," Lio said gently. "You didn't know."

"But I should have," Rowan said. "I should have thought about the consequences. I should have—"

"Should have what?" Tara asked. "Not used empathy? Not protected me? Not disrupted containment?"

Rowan didn't answer.

"There was no good choice," Lio said. "Only bad ones. And you chose the one that gave people a chance to remember. That's not nothing."

"But it's not enough," Rowan said.

"No," Wildcard's voice came from the shadows. "It's not."

Rowan's head snapped toward the sound.

Wildcard stepped into view, their presence creating a gap in the room's attention. The others didn't react. Didn't notice. Just… adjusted, making space without appearing to move.

"Wildcard," Rowan said.

Wildcard's expression was unreadable. "You made them remember. You made them feel. You made them grieve. And that's good. But it's also dangerous."

"Why?" Rowan asked.

"Because the System can correct in minutes," Wildcard said. "It can smooth away variance, remove friction, optimize behavior. Fast. Clean. Efficient."

They paused, watching the others.

"But healing takes time. It takes care. It takes people who don't give up. And even then, it might not work."

Rowan's throat tightened. "So the empathy ripple—"

"Made them feel again," Wildcard said. "But feeling what you lost isn't the same as getting it back. Some of them will remember. Some of them will grieve. And some of them won't survive the weight of it."

Rowan's vision swam.

She'd done this.

She'd caused the ripple.

She'd spread the empathy.

She'd made the city remember itself.

And feeling again wasn't the same as being whole.

Some of them would break under the weight of it.

"Rowan," Lio said. "You didn't know."

"But I should have," Rowan said. "I should have thought about the consequences. I should have—"

"Should have what?" Wildcard asked. "Not used empathy? Not disrupted containment? Not given people a chance to feel again?"

Rowan didn't answer.

"Feeling again is pain," Wildcard said. "But it's better than being empty. And you gave them that. You gave them a chance. That's not nothing."

"But it's not enough," Rowan said.

"No," Wildcard said. "It's not. But it's what you have. Empathy makes healing possible. It doesn't make it guaranteed."

Rowan's chest tightened.

Empathy makes healing possible.

It doesn't make it guaranteed.

That was the lesson.

That was the cost.

They sat in silence for a long time, processing what had happened. The ripple. The cascade. The feeling again.

And the cost.

Feeling again was pain.

But it was better than being empty.

And Rowan had given them that.

A chance.

A possibility.

A hope.

Even if it wasn't guaranteed.

Even if some of them would break.

Even if the System would correct them again.

Rowan had given them a chance to feel again.

And that was something.

That was enough.

For now.
