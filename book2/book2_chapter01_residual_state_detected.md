# Book 2 — Chapter 1: Residual State Detected

The city announced itself before it appeared.

Not with walls or gates or banners, but with a feeling Rowan couldn’t quite name—like stepping into a room where the air had already been measured and found acceptable. The road smoothed beneath their feet. The mud thinned, then vanished entirely, replaced by stone worn flat by traffic that moved the same way every day, at the same pace, with the same purpose.

Rowan noticed she was breathing shallower.

Ahead of them, buildings rose in neat, confident lines. Not tall enough to inspire awe, not cramped enough to feel desperate. Windows repeated at comfortable intervals. Streets curved gently instead of cutting sharp angles. Everything about it suggested compromise, moderation, a thousand small optimizations layered until nothing stood out.

“This place feels…” Lio trailed off, searching.

“Safe,” Kellan supplied. He sounded relieved. “Too safe, maybe, but I’ll take it.”

Rowan didn’t answer. The word sat wrong in her chest.

Safe meant predictable. Predictable meant measurable.

They crossed the threshold without ceremony. No guards stopped them. No banners declared jurisdiction. The road simply became part of the city, and the city accepted them the way a form accepts new data—quietly, without interest.

The soundscape changed first. Footsteps echoed in controlled rhythms. Voices carried just far enough to be understood, then faded. Somewhere nearby, metal rang—too regular to be accidental. Rowan tried to pick out something irregular, something out of place.

She couldn’t.

People moved around them in tidy streams. No jostling. No raised voices. A woman carrying a basket adjusted her grip at the exact moment a child darted past, never breaking stride. Two men argued softly near a fountain, their disagreement resolving itself before Rowan caught the substance of it.

Resolution without friction.

Rowan rubbed her thumb against her forefinger, a habit she hadn’t shaken from her old life. Something here reminded her of dashboards and green checkmarks and systems that only screamed after it was already too late.

Lio walked a little closer to her without comment. Kellan drifted a step ahead, scanning the street like he expected danger to jump out and announce itself.

Instead, a voice did.

“You’re new.”

The woman who stepped into their path smiled easily, like she’d practiced it in a mirror and decided it worked. She wasn’t blocking the road so much as redefining it, angling herself so stopping felt natural.

“I’m Tara,” she said. “If you’re looking for the intake hall, you overshot it.”

Kellan frowned. “We weren’t looking for anything.”

Tara laughed—not sharply, not defensively. Just a warm, imperfect sound. “That’s what everyone says.”

Rowan watched her closely. Tara’s clothes were practical but mismatched. Her hair refused to stay tied back. One sleeve had been repaired twice, badly. She shifted her weight when she stood, never quite settling into stillness.

Unoptimized.

“I can show you around,” Tara continued. “Or not. But if you’re planning to stay longer than a night, you’ll want to know which districts pretend to be friendly and which ones actually are.”

Lio smiled before Rowan realized he would. “That would help.”

Kellan shot him a look. “We don’t know her.”

Tara raised an eyebrow. “That’s true. But I know you’re carrying gear you don’t want confiscated, and I know the east ward asks fewer questions if you don’t make eye contact.”

Kellan’s jaw tightened. Rowan felt the familiar urge to intervene, to smooth the moment before it escalated. Instead, she watched Tara.

Tara didn’t press. She just waited.

The pause stretched. It should have been awkward. It wasn’t.

“Fine,” Kellan said finally. “We walk. You talk. No detours.”

Tara grinned. “Deal.”

As they moved deeper into the city, Rowan’s unease sharpened. The streets were clean without being sterile. Stalls offered food that smelled rich and filling. People smiled when spoken to.

But the smiles arrived a fraction too late.

A merchant greeted Tara by name. His voice was friendly, his words welcoming—but Rowan saw the delay. A half-beat between Tara’s wave and his response, like he’d waited for permission to react.

She felt it then. A tug behind her eyes. Not pain—pressure.

Rowan stumbled.

Lio caught her elbow instantly. “Hey.”

“I’m fine,” Rowan said automatically, then stopped. The lie tasted wrong. “I just… give me a second.”

Tara turned, concern creasing her brow. “You sick?”

Rowan shook her head. The pressure intensified, resolving into something familiar and dangerous.

Empathy.

She hadn’t reached for it. She hadn’t decided. It bloomed anyway, a residual echo stirred by proximity.

Rowan’s vision blurred—not fading, but doubling. The merchant’s face stayed where it was, smiling patiently, while something else slid underneath.

Waiting.

That was the first thing she felt. Endless, procedural waiting. Not boredom. Not calm. Waiting as a state of being, stretched thin and polished smooth.

She gasped.

Lio’s voice came from far away. “Rowan?”

The merchant spoke again, repeating his greeting word for word. His mouth moved a fraction before the sound emerged.

Rowan tore herself free.

The pressure snapped, leaving her breathless and shaking. The world rushed back in too fast—noise, color, heat. Her knees buckled.

Lio lowered her carefully to the edge of the fountain. His hands were steady. “You’re not fine.”

“I know,” Rowan whispered. Her head throbbed. It felt like she’d sprinted for miles and then been asked to solve a puzzle at gunpoint.

Tara crouched in front of her. “What happened?”

Rowan forced herself to meet Tara’s eyes. “How long has he been like that?”

Tara blinked. “Like what?”

The merchant smiled. Waited.

Rowan swallowed. “Never mind.”

The aftermath hit hard and fast. Her limbs felt heavy, her thoughts thick. Time slipped. Minutes bled into each other. The city moved on around them, unconcerned.

Kellan paced once, sharp and restless. “We should move.”

“Give her a moment,” Lio said quietly.

Rowan tried to stand. Failed. The cost pressed down on her, undeniable.

Aftermath time.

She leaned back against the stone and closed her eyes, just for a second. Fear that wasn't hers surfaced first—followed by relief at not having to choose, then the soft terror of being guided gently into stillness.

Her stomach twisted.

When she opened her eyes again, Tara was watching her differently. Not scared. Not suspicious. Just… attentive.

“You do that a lot?” Tara asked.

Rowan laughed weakly. “No.”

“Good,” Tara said. “Because this city doesn’t like things it can’t account for.”

Kellan stopped pacing. “What do you know about accounting?”

Tara shrugged. “Enough to keep my head down.”

Kellan turned to Rowan, his expression tight with calculation. "How does this place work?"
He hesitated, then added, "What does it reward?"

Rowan opened her mouth, then closed it. The question felt too close to asking the System to explain itself. "I don't know yet."

Kellan's jaw flexed. "We need to know."

As if summoned by the word, Rowan felt it—a subtle shift in the air. Attention. The city didn't change, not visibly. But something aligned.

Across the square, two figures in matching cloaks turned at the same time—not toward her, but toward the space she occupied.

System attention.

Rowan closed her eyes and breathed through the fog. One accidental use. Hours lost. The System leaning closer.

This was just the beginning.

When she finally stood, with Lio’s help, the city felt heavier. Less welcoming. Like a hand settling between her shoulder blades.

She looked at Tara. At Kellan, already calculating. At Lio, grounding and present.

The state didn't fade when the pressure did.

Rowan stepped forward anyway.
