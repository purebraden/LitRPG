# Book 2 — Chapter 4.5: Familiar Faces

They'd been walking for an hour when Rowan saw her.

A young woman with short-cropped hair, standing at a market stall, examining fruit with careful precision. Her movements were too measured, too deliberate. Her arm was bandaged—not the same bandage from before, but a fresh one, clean and white.

Mira.

Rowan stopped, her breath catching.

Lio noticed first. "Rowan?"

Rowan didn't answer. She just watched, feeling something twist in her chest. Mira looked different. Not hurt. Not scared. Just… careful. Too careful.

The way she moved reminded Rowan of something.

The way she examined the fruit, turning it over, checking for imperfections, rejecting one, accepting another. The way she counted coins, precise and methodical. The way she didn't look at the vendor, didn't make eye contact, didn't engage beyond the transaction.

It was familiar.

It was wrong.

"Rowan," Lio said again, voice quiet. "What are you seeing?"

Rowan swallowed. "Someone I know. From before."

Kellan's eyes scanned the market. "From Sable's camp?"

Rowan nodded. "Mira. She was there. She had a bandaged arm then too."

Tara shifted uneasily. "Should we—"

"Not yet," Rowan said. "Let me watch."

They stayed in the shadows, watching Mira move through the market. She was efficient. She was careful. She was optimized.

And she looked empty.

Rowan's stomach twisted.

Mira finished her transaction, accepted her purchase, and turned away. Her movements were smooth, practiced, almost mechanical. She didn't look around. She didn't notice them. She just moved, following a path that felt predetermined.

"Rowan," Lio said. "She looks—"

"Corrected," Rowan finished. "Or close to it."

Kellan's jaw tightened. "Should we approach her?"

Rowan hesitated. "I don't know. If she's corrected, she might report us. If she's not, she might be in danger."

"Then we should help her," Lio said.

Rowan looked at Mira again, at the careful way she moved, at the empty way she looked. "I don't think she wants help. I think she wants to be here."

They followed at a distance, watching Mira navigate the city. She moved with purpose, but no urgency. She followed routes that were efficient, paths that were optimized. She didn't hesitate. She didn't question. She just moved.

Like the corrected people.

But not quite.

Rowan felt something shift—a tremor, familiar and unwelcome.

The empathy ripple.

But it wasn't from her. It was from Mira.

Rowan's pulse quickened.

Mira paused at a corner, her hand hovering near her bandaged arm. For a second, her expression cracked—pain, fear, recognition—before smoothing back into place.

She wasn't fully corrected.

Not yet.

But she was close.

Rowan stepped forward, moving into Mira's path before she could think better of it.

Mira's eyes met hers, and for a heartbeat, there was recognition. Then it faded, replaced by something else—polite confusion, procedural acknowledgment.

"Hello," Mira said, her voice even, measured. "Can I help you?"

Rowan's chest tightened. "Mira. It's Rowan. From Sable's camp."

Mira's expression didn't change. "I don't recall a Sable's camp."

Rowan's stomach dropped. "You don't remember?"

Mira's head tilted slightly, as if processing. "I remember arriving in the city. I remember finding work. I remember settling here. I don't recall a camp."

Rowan looked at her bandaged arm. "What happened to your arm?"

Mira's hand moved to the bandage, almost unconsciously. "An accident. It's healing."

"An accident?"

Mira's expression grew slightly distant. "I was working. I made an error. The System corrected it. I'm more careful now."

Rowan's vision swam.

The System corrected it.

Mira had been corrected.

And she didn't remember.

Or she remembered, but it didn't matter.

Because the correction had worked.

Rowan's throat tightened. "Mira, do you remember me? Do you remember Lio? Do you remember the camp?"

Mira's eyes flicked to Lio, to Kellan, to Tara. "I don't recognize you. I'm sorry."

But her voice didn't sound sorry. It sounded procedural. Like an automated response.

Rowan stepped closer. "Mira, please. Try to remember. We were there together. You had a bandaged arm then too. You were watching. You were—"

Mira's expression shifted, just for a second. A flicker of something—pain, maybe. Or fear. Then it smoothed back into place.

"I'm sorry," Mira said again. "I don't recall. But if you need directions, I can help. The city has excellent resources for newcomers."

Rowan's chest tightened.

The city has excellent resources for newcomers.

That wasn't Mira talking.

That was the System.

Speaking through her.

Not fully. Not completely. Just enough to redirect. Just enough to normalize. Just enough to erase.

Rowan looked at Mira's bandaged arm again, at the careful way she moved, at the empty way she looked.

She'd been corrected.

And she didn't remember.

Or she remembered, but it didn't matter.

Because the correction had worked.

Rowan stepped back, feeling the weight of it press down.

"Thank you," she said, her voice quiet. "We'll find our way."

Mira nodded, polite and procedural. "The city welcomes you. I hope you find what you're looking for."

Then she turned and walked away, moving with that careful, optimized efficiency.

Rowan watched her go, feeling something break in her chest.

Mira was gone.

Not dead.

Just… erased.

The person she'd been was gone, replaced by something that looked like her, moved like her, but wasn't her.

Rowan's vision swam.

"Rowan," Lio said gently. "We should go."

Rowan didn't move. She just watched Mira disappear into the crowd, moving with that careful, optimized efficiency.

The city had taken her.

Not by force. Not by violence.

By making her forget.

By making her remember differently.

By making her believe she'd always been here, always been this way, always been optimized.

Rowan's stomach twisted.

"Rowan," Kellan said. "We need to move."

Rowan looked at him, at the way he was watching Mira, at the way he understood what had happened.

"She's gone," Rowan said.

Kellan's expression didn't change. "She's functional. She's safe. She's optimized."

"And she's gone," Rowan said again.

Kellan didn't answer.

They kept walking, moving away from the market, staying in the shadows. The city continued around them, normal and safe and wrong.

And somewhere in the crowd, Mira moved with careful, optimized efficiency.

Gone.

But not dead.

Just erased.

Rowan's chest tightened.

The city had taken her.

And it would take others.

It would take anyone who came seeking safety, seeking order, seeking optimization.

It would make them forget.

It would make them remember differently.

It would make them believe they'd always been here, always been this way, always been optimized.

And they would be gone.

Not dead.

Just erased.

Rowan looked ahead, at the uncertain streets, at the people moving through them with careful, optimized efficiency.

The city was taking them.

One by one.

Making them forget.

Making them remember differently.

Making them believe they'd always been here, always been this way, always been optimized.

And they would be gone.

Not dead.

Just erased.

Rowan kept walking, feeling the weight of it press down.

The city was taking them.

And there was nothing she could do to stop it.

Nothing except remember.

Remember who they were.

Remember what they'd lost.

Remember that they were gone.

Not dead.

Just erased.

And that was worse.

Rowan looked back once, just before they turned the corner.

Mira was gone.

Lost in the crowd.

Moving with careful, optimized efficiency.

Gone.

But not dead.

Just erased.

And Rowan would remember.

Even if Mira didn't.

Even if the city made her forget.

Even if the System made her remember differently.

Rowan would remember.

And that would have to be enough.

For now.

For always.
