# Map Placement Guide

## Map Location
**Place the city map immediately after the title page and before the Prologue.**

This allows readers to reference the city layout throughout the book, especially during:
- Chapter 1: Initial entry into the city
- Chapter 4: Market District scenes
- Chapter 4.5: Market encounter with Mira
- Chapter 6.5: Market square residual accumulation scene
- Chapter 11: Central Plaza emergency override scene
- Chapter 12: Central Plaza cascade scene
- Chapter 13: City-wide undefined behavior
- Chapter 14: Exit from the city

## Map Integration Notes

1. **Don't over-describe locations** - The map provides visual reference, so prose should focus on sensory details and emotional impact rather than exhaustive geography.

2. **Use map locations naturally** - When characters move through the city, reference map locations only when it serves the story (e.g., "They reached the Central Plaza" in Chapter 11).

3. **Maintain mystery** - Some map locations (like Correction Facility) are referenced but not fully explored, maintaining tension.

4. **Spatial awareness** - The circular, walled structure reinforces the containment theme. The concentric organization shows the System's control.

## Map Caption Suggestion

**For the map itself, include this caption:**

> *The city is organized for efficiency. The System prefers clean geometries, predictable routes, and clear boundaries. Every district serves a purpose. Every wall contains. Every watchtower observes.*
>
> *Rowan's camp lies one mile outside the containment wall—close enough to observe, far enough to remain illegible. For now.*

## Reader Experience

The map should help readers:
- Visualize the city's structure and containment
- Understand spatial relationships during action scenes
- Feel the claustrophobia of the walled city
- See the proximity of Rowan's camp (safety vs danger)
- Track the group's movement through different districts

The map reinforces the book's themes:
- **Containment** (walls, watchtowers)
- **Organization** (distinct districts, clear boundaries)
- **Surveillance** (watchtowers, admin complex)
- **Control** (correction facility, containment wall)
- **Resistance** (underground tunnels, safehouse outside)
