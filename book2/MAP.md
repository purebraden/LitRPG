## The City

The city is organized for efficiency. The System prefers clean geometries, predictable routes, and clear boundaries. Every district serves a purpose. Every wall contains. Every watchtower observes.

Rowan's camp lies one mile outside the containment wall—close enough to observe, far enough to remain illegible. For now.

## Key Locations

**Central Plaza** — The heart of the city. Where corrections are performed publicly. Where the System makes examples.

**Market District** — Where probability bends. Where small failures accumulate. Where residual permissions stack.

**Correction Facility** — Where the System processes deviations. Where cases are built. Where people are remade.

**Admin Complex** — Where the System speaks through proxies. Where containment logic is calculated. Where decisions are deferred.

**Factory Sector** — Where efficiency is measured. Where optimization is rewarded. Where people become functional.

**Underground Access Tunnels** — Where illegibility hides. Where the System's vision fails. Where escape becomes possible.

**Containment Wall** — Where the city ends. Where surveillance begins. Where the System draws the line.

**System Watchtowers** — Where observation never stops. Where patterns are recognized. Where deviations are flagged.

**Rowan's Camp** — Where resistance begins. Where the System's reach thins. Where humanity persists.

**River** — Where the city's influence wanes. Where the System's control weakens. Where healing becomes possible.

**Ruins & Wilderness** — Where the System never fully claimed. Where variance survives. Where memory remains.

*The map shows a circular, walled city divided into distinct sectors. The containment wall surrounds everything, watchtowers at regular intervals. Outside the wall, wilderness stretches to the horizon. One mile out, a small campfire marks Rowan's safehouse—a point of resistance in a world of optimization.*
