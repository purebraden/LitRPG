# Book 2 — Chapter 2: Companions Are Not Constants

Tara led them to a small room above a bakery that smelled like yeast and old wood. The space was cramped but clean, with three narrow beds pushed against the walls and a single window that overlooked a courtyard where people moved in predictable patterns.

Rowan sat on the edge of her bed, watching the courtyard below. A woman swept the same patch of stone three times, each pass identical. A man adjusted a sign, stepped back, adjusted it again, stepped back. No one seemed to notice the repetition. No one seemed to mind.

"Food's here," Lio said, setting a tray on the small table between the beds. Steam rose from bowls of thick soup and a loaf of bread that looked like it had been baked to specification—uniform, golden, perfect.

Kellan didn't move from his post by the door. "How do we know it's safe?"

Tara, who'd been leaning against the window frame, laughed softly. "You don't. But I've been eating here for months, and I'm still me."

"That's not proof," Kellan said.

"No," Tara agreed. "But it's data. You want proof, you'll be hungry a long time."

Lio picked up a bowl and handed it to Rowan. "Eat. You look like you haven't slept."

Rowan accepted it without looking away from the window. The soup was warm, rich with vegetables that tasted like they'd been grown in a lab—nutritious, balanced, slightly off. She forced herself to take another spoonful.

Tara moved closer, her shadow falling across Rowan's lap. "You're doing it again."

Rowan looked up. "Doing what?"

"Noticing." Tara's eyes were sharp, too perceptive. "You've been cataloging the city since we walked in. The way people move. The timing. The patterns."

Rowan's voice caught. "Is that a problem?"

"Depends," Tara said. "If you're just curious, fine. If you're planning something, that's different. This city doesn't like plans it didn't approve."

Kellan's voice cut in, hard. "What does that mean?"

Tara shrugged, but her shoulders were tense. "It means if you look too closely, the city looks back. And it doesn't like what it sees."

Rowan set her bowl down. The soup had gone cold faster than it should have. "What happens if it doesn't like what it sees?"

Tara's expression shifted—something between sympathy and warning. "It helps you see things differently."

Lio sat on the bed next to Rowan's, his own bowl balanced on his knees. "Tara's been here longer than us. If she says to be careful, we should listen."

Kellan's jaw flexed. "We don't know her."

"I trust her," Lio said simply.

Rowan watched the exchange, feeling the weight of it. Lio had always been quick to trust—too quick, Kellan would say. But Lio's instincts were usually right. He read people the way Rowan read systems: patterns, tells, the small signals that betrayed intent. The kind of thing you learned after enough on-call shifts, when false positives taught you to trust your gut even when the metrics looked clean.

Tara noticed Rowan watching. "You don't trust me."

It wasn't a question.

Rowan chose her words carefully. "I don't trust easily. That's not about you."

Tara's mouth twitched. "Fair. But you're going to have to decide. Because if you keep looking at this city like it's a problem to solve, it's going to solve you first."

The words hit like a physical blow. Rowan's hands curled into fists.

Kellan stepped away from the door. "What the hell does that mean?"

Tara didn't flinch. "It means the System here is subtle. It doesn't force. It suggests. It optimizes. And if you're not optimized, it helps you get there."

Rowan stood, her legs unsteady. "I need air."

"Rowan—" Lio started.

"I'm fine." She moved toward the door, but Tara blocked her path.

"Wait." Tara's voice softened. "I'm not trying to scare you. I'm trying to warn you. This place… it's not evil. It's just efficient. And efficiency doesn't leave room for questions."

Rowan's pulse thudded in her ears. "I have questions."

"I know," Tara said. "That's why I'm worried."

Rowan pushed past her and opened the door. The hallway was empty, quiet. She walked down the stairs, through the bakery's front room, and out into the street.

The city breathed around her. People moved in their patterns. The air smelled like bread and something else—something clean and chemical, like disinfectant that had been scented to seem natural.

Rowan walked without direction, letting her feet carry her. She needed to think. She needed to understand what Tara was really saying. Her mind fell into familiar patterns—assessing, cataloging, building a mental model. The same process she'd used during production incidents, when you had to understand the system before you could fix it.

Ahead, a small square opened up. A fountain sat in the center, water cascading in perfect arcs. Around it, people sat on benches, talking in low voices. Their conversations overlapped, but never interrupted. No one raised their voice. No one gestured too broadly.

Rowan found an empty bench and sat, watching.

A woman approached the fountain, a child's hand in hers. The child pointed at the water, asking something Rowan couldn't hear. The woman smiled—warm, patient, perfect.

Rowan felt it then. The pressure behind her eyes. The familiar tug of empathy wanting to reach out.

She'd felt it before, accidentally. This time, she made a choice.

Rowan let the empathy bloom.

The world doubled. The woman's face stayed where it was, smiling down at her child, while something else slid underneath.

Rowan expected emotion. Fear, joy, frustration, love—something human.

She found nothing.

Not emptiness. Not void. Nothing. A complete absence of feeling, like a file that had been deleted but the space remained. The woman's smile was real. Her movements were real. But the emotional context—the why, the weight, the texture of being—was gone.

Rowan gasped and pulled back.

The woman continued smiling. The child laughed. The moment didn't break. It just… continued.

Rowan's hands shook. She pressed them against her thighs, trying to steady herself.

The woman turned, still smiling, and met Rowan's eyes. Her expression didn't change. Her smile didn't waver. She nodded once, a polite acknowledgment, and then looked away as if Rowan was just another part of the scenery.

Rowan's stomach twisted.

She stood, legs unsteady, and walked back the way she'd come. Her head throbbed. Her thoughts felt thick, like she was trying to think through mud. Time slipped. She'd been sitting for minutes, but it felt like hours had passed.

When she reached the bakery, she had to stop and lean against the wall. Her breath came in short gasps. The world tilted slightly, refusing to settle.

Aftermath time.

The cost pressed down on her, undeniable. She'd used empathy deliberately, and now she was paying for it. Hours lost. Her body heavy, her mind foggy. She couldn't think clearly. Couldn't move quickly. It felt like the bleary exhaustion after a long incident—when the alerts had stopped but your brain was still processing, still replaying decisions, still wondering if you'd missed something critical.

Images surfaced unbidden—not hers, but echoes. The woman's procedural waiting. The absence of choice. The gentle, terrible acceptance of being guided.

Rowan's throat tightened. She swallowed hard, fighting back nausea. The woman's emptiness lingered in her chest, a hollow space where feeling should have been.

She pushed away from the wall and climbed the stairs, each step an effort. When she reached the room, the door was open. Lio stood just inside, his expression tight with worry.

"Rowan," he said, moving toward her.

Rowan shook her head. "I'm fine. Just… need to sit."

She didn't make it to the bed. Her knees buckled, and Lio caught her, lowering her carefully to the floor.

Kellan was on his feet instantly. "What happened?"

Tara crouched in front of Rowan, her eyes sharp. "You used it again, didn't you? The thing you did with the merchant."

Rowan couldn't answer. Her head pounded. Her vision blurred at the edges.

Lio's hand rested on her shoulder, steady and warm. "Breathe. Just breathe."

Rowan tried. The air felt thin, insufficient. She closed her eyes and focused on the weight of Lio's hand, the sound of his breathing, the solid reality of the floor beneath her.

When she opened her eyes again, Tara was watching her with something like recognition.

"You found it, didn't you?" Tara asked quietly. "The absence."

Rowan nodded once, too small to feel like agreement.

Tara's expression hardened. "That's what happens. That's what the city does. It doesn't kill. It doesn't hurt. It just… empties. Until there's nothing left to resist."

Kellan's voice cut in, sharp. "We need to leave."

"We can't," Tara said. "Not yet. The audit window is still open. If you leave now, the System will flag it as noncompliance."

Rowan's gut lurched. "How do you know about the audit?"

Tara's eyes flicked to Rowan's face, then away. "I know things. That's why I'm useful."

Kellan stepped closer, his shadow falling across Tara. "What else do you know?"

Tara stood, moving back. "Enough to keep you alive. Not enough to make you trust me. I get it."

Lio's hand tightened on Rowan's shoulder. "Rowan. Can you stand?"

Rowan tried. Her legs shook, but she managed to get to her feet with Lio's help. The room spun slightly, then settled.

"I'm okay," she said, and this time it was almost true. The worst of the aftermath was passing. The fog was lifting. But the emotional contamination lingered—that hollow space, that procedural waiting.

Tara moved to the window, looking out at the courtyard. "You need to be more careful. Every time you use that—whatever it is—the System notices. And it learns."

Rowan's throat tightened. "What does it learn?"

Tara's eyes flicked to the courtyard below, then back to Rowan. Her expression shifted. "Look."

Rowan moved to the window, Lio's hand still steadying her. Below, in the courtyard, a figure stood motionless. A man in clean, simple clothes, his posture perfect, his expression neutral. His shoes were aligned too perfectly with the stones beneath them, as if he'd been placed, not stepped. He wasn't looking at anything in particular. He wasn't doing anything. He just stood there, as if waiting for instructions.

Rowan's stomach dropped.

"He wasn't there before," Tara said quietly. "He appeared right after you came back."

System attention.

The corrected person didn't move. Didn't look up. Just stood, waiting, perfectly still. Like a monitoring probe that had been deployed—passive, observant, reporting back without revealing itself.

Tara turned, and her expression was grim. "That's what it learns. How to watch you. How to be ready."

The words hung in the air, heavy and final.

Kellan's voice cut in, tight with calculation. "How does this place work?"
He hesitated, then added, "What does it reward?"

Rowan looked at her companions. Lio, steady and present. Kellan, calculating and afraid. Tara, unoptimized and dangerous.

Companions were not constants. They could change. They could be taken. They could be emptied.

Rowan's hands curled into fists.

She wouldn't let that happen.

But as she stood there, feeling the last of the empathy's cost drain away, she realized something terrible: she might not have a choice.

The System was learning.

And learning meant it would not stop.

Rowan closed her eyes and breathed through the fear.
