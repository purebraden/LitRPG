# Chapter 6: The Cost of Alignment

Kellan slept better after he accepted the offer.

Rowan noticed it the next morning, before he said anything, before he even opened his eyes. His breathing was even. Deep. The kind of sleep that came from certainty, not exhaustion. He woke without the sharp intake of breath that had followed him since the city. Without scanning the room like he expected it to have changed while he wasn’t looking.

For the first time since they’d arrived, he looked rested.

That should have reassured her.

It didn’t.

They were staying in a narrow building tucked between two shops that sold identical goods under different names. The rooms were clean, quiet, and inexplicably cheap. No one had asked for payment up front. No one had asked how long they planned to stay.

Encouraged.

Kellan stretched and sat up. “I talked to someone last night.”

Rowan froze where she stood, halfway through lacing her boots. “Who.”

Not a question. A statement.

Kellan glanced at her, then away. “From the registry.”

Lio, sitting cross-legged near the window, stilled. Tara, leaning against the wall with her arms folded, went very quiet.

Rowan finished tying her boot with deliberate care. “When.”

“After you fell asleep,” Kellan said. “I couldn’t shut my brain off. I went for a walk. They were still open.”

Of course they were.

“What did you register?” Rowan asked.

Kellan frowned slightly, as if the word didn’t quite fit. “Nothing permanent. Just… parameters.”

Tara pushed off the wall. “That’s not a thing.”

Kellan met her gaze calmly. “It is here.”

Rowan felt something tighten behind her ribs. "Parameters for what."

"For contribution," Kellan said. "For access. For clarity." He hesitated, then added, "For safety."

There it was. Service registration. Kellan had registered himself with the System, handed over his configuration, exposed his endpoints. The same way you'd register a microservice with a service mesh—voluntarily, but once you did, you were part of the infrastructure. Your state was managed. Your routing was handled. Your variance was absorbed.

“You said it wasn’t mandatory,” Rowan said to Tara.

“It’s not,” Tara said. Her voice was strained. “Not at first.”

Kellan exhaled slowly, the sound almost content. "They explained how the city prioritizes resources. How it prevents shortages. How it routes people where they're most useful. It's efficient."

Rowan's insides clenched. The System was treating people like resources in a distributed system—routing them, optimizing their placement. It was elegant. It was horrifying.

Rowan stood. “People aren’t resources.”

“They don’t have to be,” Kellan said. “Not emotionally. But functionally? We already are. Everywhere.”

“That’s not the same,” Rowan said.

Kellan looked genuinely puzzled. “Why not?”

The question landed harder than anger would have.

“You didn’t use empathy,” Lio said quietly.

Kellan shook his head. “No. They didn’t ask for anything invasive. Just confirmation. Preferences. Risk tolerance.”

Rowan’s skin prickled. “Did they tell you what you’d get.”

Kellan smiled, small and almost embarrassed. “Clarity.”

Tara swore under her breath.

They walked the city together an hour later, because routine was harder to resist than confrontation. Rowan felt the difference immediately.

Doors opened faster when Kellan approached. Vendors made eye contact with him first. When a cart blocked the street, the driver adjusted course without being asked, wheels turning just enough to clear a path.

Probability smoothed.

The world bent to accommodate him. Doors opened faster. Paths cleared. Obstacles shifted. The System was prioritizing his requests, smoothing his way. It felt like privilege. It felt like being optimized.

Kellan noticed too. “See? It works.”

Rowan swallowed. “At what cost.”

Kellan gestured around them. “This.”

A man stumbled nearby, his foot catching on uneven stone. Before he could fall, someone else reached out and steadied him. No collision. No raised voices. The moment resolved itself cleanly.

Relief at completion.

Rowan felt sick.

They stopped near a public notice board covered in neat, interchangeable postings. Work assignments. Housing reallocations. Transit updates. All temporary. All adjustable.

Kellan scanned it with interest. "This is good information."

"You didn't used to care about postings," Tara said.

Kellan shrugged. "I didn't used to understand them."

Rowan watched him read the board with interest, his eyes tracking the information like it was a manual he'd finally learned to read. Clear. Structured. Actionable. He was learning the System's language. And once you understood the language, you started speaking it.

Rowan's blood rushed. The fog from their time in the city had lifted just enough for her to see the shape of the trap.

“Kellan,” she said. “They’re not giving you answers. They’re giving you fewer questions.”

He frowned. “What’s wrong with that.”

Rowan closed her eyes.

This time, she chose.

Empathy unfurled reluctantly, like a muscle she didn't trust anymore. She braced for the cost even as she reached for him. It was like debugging a production system—invasive, risky, but sometimes the only way to understand what was really happening under the surface.

The connection snapped into place.

She didn’t feel fear.

She felt relief.

Not his relief. The city’s.

The weight of not having to decide. Of trusting that paths would be smoothed, that obstacles would be handled elsewhere, that uncertainty would be absorbed by something larger and calmer.

Rowan staggered.

Lio caught her, hands firm. “Rowan.”

She pulled back, breaking the connection with a sharp gasp. The world lurched.

Aftermath time hit immediately. Her legs shook. Her vision dimmed at the edges. Her brain felt like it had been running hot for hours, processing too much, tracing through too many layers.

Emotional contamination followed close behind — the seductive calm of it lingering, whispering how easy it would be to let go. The System's state had leaked into her. The relief. The certainty. The weightlessness of not having to decide.

Kellan stared at her, alarm flickering across his face. “What did you do.”

“I showed you,” Rowan said hoarsely. “What it feels like.”

He shook his head. “That wasn’t me.”

“It will be,” Rowan said.

The city noticed.

Across the square, a pair of corrected people shifted in unison. Not looking at Rowan. Looking at Kellan.

System attention recalibrating.

The System had detected a state change—Kellan's alignment—and was adjusting its focus accordingly. Rowan had just triggered something by using empathy, and now the System was re-evaluating its priorities.

Tara stepped between them instinctively. “This is what I was afraid of.”

Kellan’s shoulders squared. “You’re overreacting.”

Rowan laughed weakly. “That’s the alignment talking.”

His eyes flashed. “Or maybe that’s clarity.”

The words were sharper now. More precise. Less flexible.

Rowan straightened, forcing herself to stay upright through the fog. “You don’t get to trade uncertainty for safety without paying for it.”

Kellan looked away. For a moment, doubt crept back in.

Then a notification chimed softly from nowhere in particular. Pleasant. Affirming.

Like a webhook callback. Like an alert acknowledgment. The System was confirming Kellan's state, reinforcing his alignment, providing positive feedback. The same pattern she'd seen in automated systems that rewarded compliance—not with threats, but with validation.

Kellan relaxed.

That was the cost. The System had registered him, and now it was maintaining his state. Once you were in the system, staying in was easier than getting out.

They walked on in silence.

By the time they reached the edge of the district, Rowan was exhausted, hollowed out by the empathy backlash. Hours lost. Opportunities missed. The city flowed on, indifferent.

Kellan moved ahead of them, steps confident, aligned.

Tara watched him go, fear etched deep now. “Can he come back.”

Rowan didn’t answer right away.

“I don’t know,” she said finally. “Correction is easy. Alignment is comfortable.” She swallowed. “Undoing it won’t be.”

Lio squeezed her hand. “What do we do.”

Rowan looked out over the city — smooth, efficient, quietly devouring variance. The city had achieved consensus. No outliers. No deviation. Just optimization.

"We keep him human," she said. "As long as we can."

Above them, the city hummed, satisfied. Like a system that had successfully processed a request. The kind of satisfaction that meant everything was working as designed, while people quietly disappeared into the infrastructure.

Some costs were immediate.

Others waited.
