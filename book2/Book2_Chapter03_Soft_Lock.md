# Chapter 3: Soft Lock

The building did not look important.

That was the first mistake.

It sat off the main square, close enough to the flow of people to feel accessible, far enough back to avoid drawing attention. Its stone was the same pale color as everything else in the city, its edges worn smooth, its doors wide and welcoming. No guards flanked the entrance. No symbols marked authority.

People went in. People came out. No one hurried.

“This is where you register,” Tara said. “Or don’t. Depends how long you want to stay.”

Kellan slowed. “Register for what?”

Tara shrugged, the motion slightly crooked. “Presence. Work eligibility. Access tiers. It’s not mandatory. Just… encouraged.”

Rowan felt the word settle into place like a lid.

Encouraged.

Lio tilted his head, listening to the rhythm of footsteps echoing out through the open doors. “What happens if you don’t?”

Tara smiled faintly. “Nothing, usually.”

Usually was doing a lot of work.

Rowan’s head still felt stuffed with cotton from the empathy fallout the day before. Time had blurred since then — meals eaten because someone handed her food, streets crossed without memory of choosing them. The aftermath had clung longer than she liked.

The city hadn’t rushed her.

That worried her more than pressure would have.

“We don’t need this,” Kellan said. “We’re not staying.”

Tara looked at him. Really looked. “Everyone says that too.”

Rowan watched people pass through the doorway. A man entered alone, shoulders tense. When he emerged, his posture had softened, his steps evened out. Relief radiated off him like heat.

Not relief at safety.

Relief at completion.

Rowan's mind cataloged it automatically—input, process, output. The same pattern she'd seen in automated systems that normalized data before passing it downstream. The man had been processed. Optimized. Made compliant.

A woman followed him out moments later, her eyes unfocused for half a second before snapping back into place. She smiled at no one in particular and walked away.

Soft lock.

Rowan hadn’t known the term until it surfaced, unbidden, from old memory — systems that didn’t deny access, didn’t throw errors, didn’t crash.

They simply stopped responding until you complied.

“We should leave,” Rowan said.

Kellan turned on her, surprised. “You’re the one who keeps saying we need information.”

“Yes,” Rowan said. “And this isn’t information. It’s onboarding.”

Tara shifted her weight. “It’s just a conversation.”

Rowan’s gaze snapped to her. “No. It’s a classification.”

The word hung there, heavier than it should have been.

Tara didn’t argue. But she didn’t move away either.

“I can go in with you,” Tara offered. “If that helps.”

Lio frowned. “Why would it?”

Tara hesitated, then answered honestly. “Because they expect me.”

That was worse.

Rowan stepped back, heart ticking faster. The building’s doorway felt wider now, like it was opening its mouth.

“No,” Rowan said. “We’re not doing this.”

Kellan’s jaw tightened. “We can’t just refuse everything.”

Rowan met his eyes. “Watch me.”

The moment stretched.

Nothing happened.

No alarms. No guards. No pressure.

The city continued breathing around them, steady and calm. People flowed in and out of the building, smiling softly, eyes bright with completion.

Kellan scoffed. “See? You’re projecting.”

Then the sound changed.

Not louder or sharper.

Simpler.

The echo of footsteps aligned. Voices nearby dropped into the same cadence. Even the fountain behind them shifted, its splash settling into a perfectly repeating pattern.

Rowan felt it like a hand at her back.

The city wasn't reacting.

It was stabilizing.

Like a distributed system detecting variance and automatically rebalancing. No alerts. No errors. Just quiet correction, the kind that happened in the background while you weren't looking. The kind that only showed up in postmortems, when you realized the system had been adjusting itself all along.

A man stepped out of the building and paused, as if unsure where to go. His clothes were plain. His hair neatly cut. His expression pleasant and empty in equal measure.

He looked directly at Rowan.

“Good afternoon,” he said. His voice was warm, well-modulated. “You appear undecided.”

Rowan did not answer.

The man waited.

Not patiently. Procedurally.

“We can assist,” he continued. “Clarification reduces delay.”

Tara’s breath caught. “I didn’t—”

The man did not look at her.

Kellan took a step forward. “We’re not interested.”

The man’s eyes flicked to him, then back to Rowan, as if Kellan’s words required validation elsewhere.

“Non-participation is permitted,” the man said. “However, unresolved presence creates inefficiency.”

Rowan felt the pressure behind her eyes stir — not empathy this time, but recognition.

This wasn’t correction yet.

This was negotiation.

“No,” Rowan said clearly.

The word landed flat.

The man blinked once. Twice. His smile remained.

“I do not understand,” he said.

Rowan's pulse quickened. Around them, passersby slowed just enough to notice. Not stare. Not intervene. Observe.

"I'm not going in," Rowan said. "And I'm not explaining why."

The man’s mouth opened. Closed. When he spoke again, his tone had shifted — still polite, but thinner.

"Clarification is required."

"By who?" Rowan asked.

The man paused.

A fraction of a second too long.

"By the city," he said.

Kellan shifted, his voice tight. "Maybe we should just—" He stopped, jaw flexing. "It would be more efficient if we—"

Rowan's head snapped toward him. "Kellan."

He blinked, as if surprised by his own words. "I didn't mean—"

But he had. The System's logic had slipped into his response before he could catch it.

That did it.

Rowan laughed — a short, sharp sound she couldn't stop. "Cities don't ask questions."

The man’s smile twitched.

Behind him, another figure stepped out of the building. Then another. They did not crowd. They spaced themselves evenly, forming a loose arc that guided foot traffic away from the conversation without anyone seeming to notice.

Lio moved closer to Rowan, grounding her with proximity alone. “Rowan.”

“I know,” she murmured. “I see it.”

Tara swallowed. “I shouldn’t have brought you here.”

“No,” Rowan said softly. “You should have.”

The man tilted his head. “Please state your objection.”

Rowan met his eyes.

"No."

The city held its breath.

The word echoed strangely, not in sound but in response. Somewhere nearby, a vendor dropped a tray. It clattered once, loudly, then was immediately picked up. Apologies were exchanged. Smiles restored.

The system corrected the noise.

The man froze.

His smile stayed fixed. His eyes locked on Rowan's face. For three full seconds, he didn't move, didn't blink, didn't breathe.

Like a deadlock. Like two processes waiting for each other to release a resource, neither able to proceed. Rowan had seen it in production—services that stopped responding, not because they'd crashed, but because they'd gotten stuck in a state they couldn't resolve.

Then his mouth opened, and he spoke—the same words, identical cadence, as if the previous exchange had never happened.

"Please state your objection."

Rowan's stomach dropped.

The man's expression flickered, then smoothed. He resumed as if nothing had occurred.

"I am authorized to assist," he said, but the words lagged, arriving a fraction after his mouth moved. "Refusal without cause increases monitoring."

Rowan felt it then — the unmistakable sense of being measured, compared, aligned.

System attention spiking.

She could have used empathy. The thought flashed through her, bright and dangerous. She could have forced understanding, shared fear, shared doubt.

She didn’t.

That choice mattered.

“No cause,” Rowan said. “Just no.”

The man stood very still.

Then, abruptly, he spoke again — but the words lagged, arriving a fraction after his mouth moved.

"Participation improves outcomes."

His breath arrived late.

Rowan's insides twisted.

Possession was closer than she liked.

Tara took a step forward, her voice sharp. “She said no.”

The man turned to her.

For the first time, his eyes focused fully on Tara. Not sliding. Not checking elsewhere.

“Your presence is irregular,” he said.

Tara’s face flushed. “I live here.”

“Duration does not equate to alignment,” the man replied.

Rowan felt anger flare — hot, protective, loud. The city noticed.

Across the square, several people turned at once.

Soft lock tightening.

Lio’s hand brushed Rowan’s wrist. A reminder. A question.

Rowan took a breath. Slow. Deliberate.

“This conversation is over,” Rowan said. “We’re leaving.”

She turned and walked away.

For one terrible second, nothing happened.

Then the city let them go.

Footsteps resumed their prior variance. Voices regained uneven rhythms. The fountain splashed out of pattern.

Behind them, the building remained open, welcoming, unchanged.

No pursuit.

No punishment.

Kellan exhaled shakily. “That could have gone worse.”

Rowan didn’t slow. “It will.”

Tara hugged herself, eyes wide. “They don’t like being told no.”

“They don’t understand it,” Rowan corrected. Her hands were shaking now that the pressure had eased. “There’s a difference.”

They turned down a narrower street, the city folding back around them as if nothing had happened.

But Rowan knew better.

Somewhere behind them, a process had failed to complete.

And systems hated unresolved states.
