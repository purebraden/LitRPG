# Chapter 8.5: Alignment Visible

The walk away from the plaza was quiet.

Too quiet.

Rowan kept her hand on Lio's arm, using him as an anchor while aftermath time pressed down. Her legs felt weak. Her vision swam. The emotional bleed from the proxy authority encounter was still settling, calm thoughts whispering how easy it would be to stop resisting.

But underneath the calm, something else.

Awareness.

Kellan walked ahead of them, his posture efficient, his movements precise. He didn't look back. Didn't check on them. Just moved, scanning intersections, calculating routes, clearing paths with body language that felt practiced.

Useful.

And wrong.

Rowan's stomach twisted. She'd seen it in the plaza—the way the System had recognized him. "Alignment confirmed." The words had been clean, procedural, absolute.

And Kellan's shoulders had eased.

Almost imperceptible.

But she'd seen it.

"Rowan," Lio said quietly. "How are you?"

Rowan didn't answer right away. She looked at Kellan, at the way he moved, at the way he was already adapting to the city's patterns.

"I'm fine," she said. "But Kellan—"

Lio's grip tightened on her arm. "I know."

They kept walking, moving through side streets, staying in the shadows. The city continued around them, normal and safe and wrong. People moved in predictable patterns. Conversations followed scripts. Everything was contained.

Everything was controlled.

And Kellan was part of it.

They reached a small square, and Kellan stopped, pointing to a narrow passage between buildings. "This way. It's more efficient."

Rowan looked at the passage. At the way it cut through the city's structure. At the way it would save time, save steps, save energy.

Efficient.

And predictable.

"Kellan," Rowan said. "How did you know that was there?"

Kellan's expression didn't change. "I calculated the route."

"Calculated how?"

Kellan's jaw tightened. "By observing patterns. By understanding flow. By—"

"By aligning with the System," Tara said quietly.

Kellan's head snapped toward her. "What?"

Tara's hands were shaking, but her voice was steady. "You're moving like them. You're thinking like them. You're—"

"I'm trying to keep us alive," Kellan said, his voice sharp.

"By becoming legible," Rowan said.

Kellan's expression cracked. Just for a second. Then it smoothed back into place. "I'm not—"

"You are," Lio said gently. "And it's working. The System recognizes you. It rewards you. It makes things easier for you."

Kellan's hands clenched. "That's not—"

"True?" Rowan asked. "Kellan, in the plaza, when the System said 'Alignment confirmed,' your shoulders eased. You relaxed. You felt—"

"Relief," Kellan finished, his voice quiet. "I felt relief."

The words hung in the air between them.

Relief.

At being recognized.

At being aligned.

At being legible.

Rowan's chest tightened. "Kellan—"

"I know," Kellan said. "I know what it means. I know what's happening. But I can't—"

He stopped.

They kept walking, moving through the passage Kellan had identified. It was efficient. It was direct. It saved time.

And it felt wrong.

They emerged into another square, and Kellan stopped again, scanning the space, calculating routes, identifying the most efficient path.

"Kellan," Rowan said. "Stop."

Kellan's head turned toward her. "What?"

"Stop optimizing," Rowan said. "Stop calculating. Stop being efficient."

Kellan's expression grew tight. "Why?"

"Because efficiency is what the System wants," Rowan said. "Because optimization is what it rewards. Because being legible is what makes you useful."

Kellan's jaw flexed. "And being illegible is what gets you corrected."

"Maybe," Rowan said. "But being legible is what makes you part of the System. And I don't want you to be part of it."

Kellan's expression cracked again. This time, it didn't smooth back. "I'm trying to protect you. All of you. I'm trying to keep us alive."

"I know," Rowan said. "But at what cost?"

Kellan didn't answer.

They kept walking, moving through the square, staying in the shadows. The city continued around them, normal and safe and wrong. People moved in predictable patterns. Conversations followed scripts. Everything was contained.

Everything was controlled.

And Kellan was becoming part of it.

They reached a small market, and Kellan stopped again, pointing to a vendor's stall. "We should get supplies. That vendor has the best prices. The most efficient route."

Rowan looked at the vendor. At the way they moved, at the way they calculated, at the way they optimized.

Just like Kellan.

"Kellan," Rowan said. "Look at them."

Kellan's eyes flicked to the vendor. "What about them?"

"They're corrected," Rowan said. "They're optimized. They're efficient. And they're empty."

Kellan's expression didn't change. "They're functional."

"They're not human," Lio said quietly.

Kellan's head snapped toward him. "What does that mean?"

"It means they've lost something," Lio said. "Something important. Something that makes them human."

"And you think that's happening to me," Kellan said.

"I think it's a risk," Rowan said. "I think the System is rewarding you for being efficient. For being legible. For being useful. And I think that reward feels good. I think it feels like relief. I think it feels like safety."

Kellan's hands clenched. "It does."

The words hung in the air between them.

It does.

The alignment feels good.

The efficiency feels safe.

The legibility feels like relief.

And that's the problem.

Rowan's chest tightened. "Kellan, I'm not asking you to stop being strategic. I'm not asking you to stop being useful. I'm asking you to stop being optimized."

Kellan's expression grew pained. "How?"

"I don't know," Rowan said. "But I know that if you keep optimizing, if you keep being efficient, if you keep being legible—"

"The System will claim you," Lio finished.

Kellan's breath hitched. "I don't want that."

"I know," Rowan said. "But it's happening anyway. And I don't know how to stop it."

They kept walking, moving through the market, staying in the shadows. The city continued around them, normal and safe and wrong. People moved in predictable patterns. Conversations followed scripts. Everything was contained.

Everything was controlled.

And Kellan was becoming part of it.

They reached the edge of the market, and Kellan stopped, looking back at the vendor they'd passed.

"They're functional," he said again, his voice quiet. "They're efficient. They're useful."

"And they're empty," Rowan said.

Kellan's expression cracked. This time, it stayed cracked. "I don't want to be empty."

"I know," Rowan said. "But I don't know how to stop it."

They kept walking, moving out of the market, staying in the shadows. The city continued around them, normal and safe and wrong. People moved in predictable patterns. Conversations followed scripts. Everything was contained.

Everything was controlled.

And Kellan was becoming part of it.

Rowan's stomach twisted.

She didn't know how to stop it.

She didn't know how to protect him.

She just knew that alignment was visible now.

And that was dangerous.

For him.

For all of them.
