# Book 2 — Chapter 12.75: Aftermath

They found him in a small room above a shop, sitting by a window, staring out at the city below.

David.

The man with haunted eyes, standing alone, lost in thought.

Except now he wasn't standing. He was sitting. And he wasn't lost in thought. He was just… there. Present. Aware.

Rowan stopped at the doorway, watching.

David didn't look up. He just kept staring out the window, his expression distant, haunted.

But not empty.

There was something in the way he moved, in the way he breathed, in the way he looked at the city with something that wasn't quite recognition, wasn't quite understanding.

It was pain.

Rowan's pulse quickened.

"David," she said quietly.

David's shoulders tensed. He didn't look up, but his hands clenched. "I don't know that name."

Rowan stepped into the room. "From Sable's camp. You were there. You stood alone. You had haunted eyes."

David's head lifted, just slightly. His eyes met hers, and for a heartbeat, there was something—pain, fear, recognition—before it faded.

"I remember arriving in the city," David said, his voice quiet, measured. "I remember finding work. I remember settling here. I don't recall a camp."

Rowan's chest tightened. "What about the haunted eyes? What about standing alone? What about Sable?"

David's expression didn't change. "I've always been here. I've always worked here. I've always been alone."

Rowan looked at the room, at the window, at the careful way David moved. "How long have you been here?"

David's hands unclenched. "As long as I can remember."

"And before that?"

David's movements stilled. "There was no before. I've always been here."

Rowan's stomach twisted.

I've always been here.

That wasn't true.

But David believed it.

Or he remembered it differently.

Or the System had made him forget.

Rowan stepped closer. "David, please. Try to remember. We were there together. You stood alone. You had haunted eyes. You were—"

David's expression cracked—pain, fear, recognition—before smoothing back into place.

"I'm sorry," David said, his voice quiet. "I don't recall. But if you need directions, I can help. The city has excellent resources for newcomers."

Rowan's vision swam.

The city has excellent resources for newcomers.

That wasn't David talking.

That was the System.

Speaking through him.

Not fully. Not completely. Just enough to redirect. Just enough to normalize. Just enough to erase.

Rowan looked at David's haunted eyes, at the careful way he moved, at the empty way he looked.

He'd been corrected.

And he didn't remember.

Or he remembered, but it didn't matter.

Because the correction had worked.

Rowan's throat tightened. "David, do you remember the camp? Do you remember Sable? Do you remember standing alone? Do you remember—"

David's head snapped up. "Don't."

Rowan stopped.

David's expression was tight, pained. "Don't make me remember. Don't make me feel. Don't make me—"

"Remember what you lost?" Rowan asked.

David's hands shook. "I haven't lost anything. I'm here. I'm working. I'm functional. I'm—"

"Empty," Rowan finished.

David's expression cracked. "I'm not empty. I'm optimized. I'm efficient. I'm—"

"Gone," Rowan said.

David's breath hitched. "I'm not gone. I'm here. I'm working. I'm—"

"Not you," Rowan said. "Not the person you were. Not the person who remembered the camp, who remembered Sable, who remembered standing alone. That person is gone. You're just—"

"Functional," David finished, his voice quiet. "I'm functional."

Rowan's chest tightened.

Functional.

But not human.

Not the person he'd been.

Just functional.

Rowan looked at David's haunted eyes, at the careful way he moved, at the empty way he looked.

He'd been corrected.

And he didn't remember.

Or he remembered, but it didn't matter.

Because the correction had worked.

But then something shifted.

A tremor, familiar and unwelcome.

The empathy ripple.

It had reached him too.

David's expression changed, just for a second. Pain. Fear. Recognition.

Then it faded.

But not completely.

There was something left.

A flicker.

A trace.

A memory.

Rowan's pulse quickened.

"David," she said. "Do you feel it? The ripple? The remembering?"

David's hands clenched. "I don't—"

"Try," Rowan said. "Please. Try to remember. The camp. Sable. Standing alone. The haunted eyes. The—"

David's expression cracked again—pain, fear, recognition—and this time, it didn't smooth back.

"I remember," David said, his voice quiet, broken. "I remember the camp. I remember Sable. I remember standing alone. I remember—"

He stopped, breath hitching.

"I remember what I lost," David said. "I remember what the System took. I remember what I was. I remember—"

He stopped again, his hands shaking.

"I remember," David said. "And it hurts."

Rowan's chest tightened.

I remember.

And it hurts.

The empathy ripple had reached him.

It had made him remember.

It had made him feel.

It had made him grieve.

And it hurt.

Rowan stepped closer. "David—"

"Don't," David said. "Don't make me remember more. Don't make me feel more. Don't make me—"

"Grieve?" Rowan asked.

David's expression broke. "I'm grieving. I'm feeling. I'm remembering. And it hurts. And I don't know if I can—"

"Survive it?" Rowan finished.

David didn't answer.

He just sat there, shaking, remembering, feeling, grieving.

The empathy ripple had reached him.

It had made him remember.

It had made him feel.

It had made him grieve.

And it hurt.

Rowan's vision swam.

She'd done this.

She'd caused the ripple.

She'd spread the empathy.

She'd made the city remember itself.

And it hurt.

Some of them were recovering.

Some of them weren't.

And David was remembering.

And it hurt.

Rowan's throat tightened. "David, I'm sorry."

David's expression didn't change. "For what?"

"For making you remember. For making you feel. For making you—"

"Grieve?" David asked.

Rowan didn't answer.

David's hands unclenched. "I'm grieving. I'm feeling. I'm remembering. And it hurts. But it's better than being empty."

Rowan's chest tightened.

It's better than being empty.

That was the lesson.

That was the cost.

Remembering hurt.

But it was better than being empty.

Rowan looked at David's haunted eyes, at the careful way he moved, at the way he was remembering, feeling, grieving.

He wasn't gone.

Not yet.

Not completely.

The empathy ripple had reached him.

It had made him remember.

It had made him feel.

It had made him grieve.

And it hurt.

But it was better than being empty.

Rowan stepped back. "I'm sorry."

David's expression didn't change. "For what?"

"For making you remember. For making you feel. For making you—"

"Grieve?" David asked.

Rowan didn't answer.

David's hands resumed their careful movements, but there was something different now. Something that wasn't quite empty, wasn't quite optimized.

It was pain.

It was grief.

It was remembering.

And it hurt.

But it was better than being empty.

Rowan turned away, feeling the weight of it press down.

David was remembering.

And it hurt.

But it was better than being empty.

The empathy ripple had reached him.

It had made him remember.

It had made him feel.

It had made him grieve.

And it hurt.

But it was better than being empty.

Rowan looked back once, just before they left.

David was still sitting by the window, staring out at the city below.

Remembering.

Feeling.

Grieving.

And it hurt.

But it was better than being empty.

Rowan kept walking, feeling the weight of it press down.

The empathy ripple had reached them.

It had made them remember.

It had made them feel.

It had made them grieve.

And it hurt.

But it was better than being empty.

And that was the lesson.

That was the cost.

Remembering hurt.

But it was better than being empty.

And Rowan would remember.

Even if it hurt.

Even if it cost.

Even if it wasn't enough.

She would remember.

And that would have to be enough.

For now.

For always.
