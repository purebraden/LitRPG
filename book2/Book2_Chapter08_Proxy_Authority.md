# Chapter 8: Proxy Authority

The city felt finished.

Rowan noticed it in the absence of small errors. No dropped objects. No late responses. No awkward pauses where people recalculated how to continue. The streets moved with a confidence that hadn't been there before, as if uncertainty itself had been trimmed away overnight.

After the gaps, after Wildcard's appearance, the city had adapted.

Rowan walked slower than the others. Not because she was tired—though she was—but because moving too quickly felt wrong, like interrupting something mid-process. The aftermath of her deliberate violation hadn’t faded. It had flattened.

Urgency was gone.

That frightened her more than pain would have.

Her emotions arrived muted, smoothed into something manageable. Fear without edges. Concern without heat. Even anger felt procedural, queued behind other thoughts and dismissed when it couldn’t justify itself.

Containment wasn’t a cage.

It was insulation.

Kellan, by contrast, moved easily. He adjusted his pace without thinking, aligning himself with traffic flow and conversational rhythms. When a vendor hesitated over change, Kellan supplied the exact amount without prompting. When two people reached the same doorway, he stepped aside at precisely the right moment.

“Go ahead,” he said, already turning away.

Helpful. Calm. Efficient.

Rowan watched him with a hollow ache.

They crossed a plaza where a public process was unfolding—registration, reassignment, something administrative enough that no one questioned its presence. A corrected man stood near the center, posture straight, expression neutral.

He turned toward Rowan.

“Excuse me,” he said.

His voice was gentle. Courteous. Entirely human.

Rowan stopped.

The others slowed behind her. The flow of the plaza adjusted, foot traffic bending just enough to give the interaction space without anyone appearing to notice.

“Yes?” Rowan said.

The man smiled. It was a good smile. Practiced, but not false. “A brief clarification is required.”

Rowan’s pulse ticked once, sharp and contained.

“What kind of clarification?” she asked.

The man's eyes flicked—not to her face, but slightly to the left, as if checking something that wasn't there. When he spoke again, his head remained still, but his eyes drifted right, then back, tracking something Rowan couldn't see. His tone remained even.

“Regarding recent behavioral variance.”

There it was.

Lio shifted closer to Rowan, close enough that his shoulder brushed hers. “You don’t have to answer that.”

The man nodded politely. “Participation is optional.”

Optional.

“But unresolved variance increases monitoring overhead,” he continued. “This interaction is intended to reduce inefficiency.”

Rowan felt the weight of attention settle—not pressure, not threat. Alignment.

She tried empathy.

It wasn’t a choice this time. Reflex took over, the way a hand reaches out before you’ve decided to touch something hot.

The connection didn’t open.

It slid.

Her awareness skimmed past the man’s emotional surface and struck something layered behind him—dense, ordered, calm.

Approval.

Not his.

The System’s.

Rowan recoiled as if burned.

The man blinked once. His smile held.

“Overlap detected,” he said mildly. “Narrative contamination remains unresolved.”

The words arrived cleanly, but something underneath them stuttered. A pause too long. A restart without acknowledgement. His mouth had opened a fraction of a second before the sound began, as if the voice were catching up to the intent.

“I don’t understand,” Rowan said carefully.

"That is expected," the man replied. "Cause-effect chains are incomplete." His head tilted slightly, as if listening to something. "Classification pending."

Behind him, a corrected woman turned her head in perfect synchronization with the sentence’s end. Another adjusted their stance. The plaza’s soundscape softened, conversations dimming as if someone had turned down a dial.

The System wasn’t angry.

It was thinking.

“This vector will be observed,” the man continued. “Repetition will be interpreted as intent.”

Kellan stepped forward, voice calm. “She’s not causing harm.”

The man looked at him then—really looked. His eyes focused cleanly, without drift.

“Alignment confirmed,” the man said.

Rowan felt something twist in her chest.

“Tara,” Rowan said quietly. “Don’t say anything.”

Too late.

“This is wrong,” Tara said. Not loudly. Not angrily. Just honestly. “You can’t talk about people like they’re—”

The man’s attention slid away from Tara mid-sentence.

Not dismissal.

Routing.

The conversation bent around her words, flowing past as if she hadn’t spoken. Two people nearby stepped between Tara and the group without appearing to move. Their bodies simply occupied the space where attention might have landed.

Tara fell silent, breath hitching.

Social invisibility.

The man returned his focus to Rowan. “Stability has been preserved,” he said. “No corrective action is required at this time.”

“No,” Rowan said. Her voice sounded flat to her own ears. “You’re not done.”

The man paused.

For a fraction of a second, his mouth opened without sound.

“Proxy authority engaged,” he said at last.

Rowan felt it then—the line she'd crossed when she'd used empathy deliberately, when she'd violated containment, becoming visible from the other side.

“You’re speaking for it,” she said.

The man inclined his head. “Authority is routed through compliant structures.”

Rowan swallowed. “You don’t need a body.”

“No,” the man agreed. “Bodies are convenient.”

Something flickered at the edge of the plaza. A moment where a response should have occurred and didn’t.

The man’s speech faltered.

“Correction parameters—” he began, then stopped. His eyes unfocused, smile straining. “Reference unavailable.”

Wildcard’s absence.

Not presence. Not interference.

Just a hole.

The plaza exhaled. The corrected people resumed their idle states. Sound returned in uneven layers.

The man blinked, once, twice. When he spoke again, his tone was human.

“I believe we’re finished here,” he said. “Thank you for your time.”

He stepped back into the flow and was gone.

Rowan’s legs shook.

Aftermath time crashed down harder than before, swallowing minutes whole. Emotional bleed followed—calm pressing at her thoughts, whispering how easy it would be to stop resisting.

Kellan steadied her. His grip was firm, reassuring. “You handled that well.”

Rowan looked up at him. At the certainty in his expression. At how easily the System had found a voice through him, if it needed one.

“No,” she said softly. “It handled me.”

Tara hugged herself, pale. “It didn’t even look at me.”

“That’s worse,” Lio said.

Rowan closed her eyes.

The System hadn’t threatened her. Hadn’t punished her. Hadn’t tried to stop her.

It had clarified boundaries.

Proxy authority.

It didn’t speak with its own voice.

It spoke through compliance.

And now it knew exactly where Rowan stood.
