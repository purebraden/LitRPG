# Book 2 — Chapter 11: Emergency Override

The correction began without announcement.

Rowan felt it as a shift in the city's posture, a tightening that was sharper than before. Not a funnel this time. A clamp. The streets did not narrow; they *aligned*. Foot traffic synchronized in subtle waves. Conversations shortened. Decisions resolved faster.

Containment had escalated.

"Tara," Rowan said quietly. "Stay with me."

Tara nodded, but her eyes were already darting. Every corrected person they passed seemed closer than the last, standing at intervals that were no longer coincidental.

They reached the plaza before Rowan realized where they were being routed. The space was open, sunlit, ordinary. That was the worst part. No barriers. No guards. Just people moving through clean lines.

A corrected woman stepped forward.

"Tara," she said, smiling. "Please come with me."

It wasn't a request.

Tara froze.

"What for?" Tara asked, voice thin. "You still haven't told me what I did."

The corrected woman's eyes tracked independently of her head, drifting for a heartbeat before returning. "Clarification," she said. Her mouth moved a fraction before the sound arrived. "Behavioral variance review."

Rowan's chest tightened. The file was closed enough.

This was the action phase.

"No," Rowan said, stepping between them. "She's not going anywhere."

The corrected woman did not look at Rowan. Her attention slid past, rerouting. Two other corrected people adjusted their positions, forming a loose arc that guided foot traffic away from the interaction.

Emergency override engaged.

Rowan felt the weight of it settle—heavy, procedural, absolute.

"Tara," Rowan said, without looking back. "Whatever happens next, don't answer questions. Don't explain. Don't justify."

Tara's breath shook. "Rowan—"

Rowan reached for empathy.

Not a brush this time. Not a cautious echo.

She plunged.

The connection tore open, ripping past emotional surface and procedural calm into something deeper—and wrong.

Approval flooded her.

Not relief. Not emptiness.

Approval with conditions.

Rowan gasped as images crashed through her: Tara's reactions logged as data points, each deviation annotated, weighted, normalized. A model converging. A recommendation forming.

Correction was not punishment.

It was optimization.

Rowan forced herself to hold the connection, even as pain lanced behind her eyes and time stretched thin. She pushed *sideways*, not deeper—aiming not for the corrected woman, but for the *process* running through her.

Residual permissions flared.

Hesitation rippled outward. The corrected woman paused mid-step. Another blinked, mouth opening and closing once without sound.

The plaza stuttered.

The System reacted instantly.

Possession snapped into place.

The corrected woman straightened, smile locking into something too precise. Her eyes tracked something Rowan couldn't see.

"Unauthorized state sharing detected," she said. The words lagged, then corrected themselves. "Emergency override authorized."

Rowan's vision tunneled.

Lio grabbed her shoulders, grounding her. "Rowan!"

She was running out of time.

"Wildcard," Rowan whispered—not a call, not a prayer. Just an acknowledgment of absence.

Nothing appeared.

Instead, something *failed*.

A corrected man at the edge of the plaza did not move when he should have. His attention slipped, unfocused. A gap—small, but real—opened in the correction chain.

Rowan shoved *into* it.

Residual permissions collided violently. Probability skewed. A vendor's cart tipped at exactly the wrong moment, drawing attention. A child laughed, loud and sharp, cutting through the procedural quiet.

Noise.

Variance.

The System hesitated.

Rowan tore herself free.

She collapsed against Lio, breath ragged, body shaking. Aftermath time crashed down like a wave—minutes evaporating, strength draining, emotional bleed pressing at her thoughts with seductive calm.

"Tara," Rowan rasped. "Run."

Tara didn't argue.

She bolted.

The plaza erupted—not in chaos, but in recalculation. Corrected people repositioned, trying to reestablish flow. The corrected woman's head tilted, listening.

"Subject relocated," she said. "Correction deferred. Case remains open."

Deferred.

Again.

Rowan laughed weakly as Lio hauled her to her feet. "They hate that."

"They'll adapt," Kellan said, voice tight. He was already scanning exits, patterns, routes.

"I know," Rowan said. Her vision swam. "That's why we can't stay."

They fled down a side street as the city closed ranks behind them, containment reasserting itself with quiet efficiency.

When they finally stopped, hidden in the narrow shadow between buildings, Rowan slid down the wall, exhausted to the bone.

Tara crouched in front of her, eyes bright with fear and something like awe. "You… you broke it."

"No," Rowan said. "I interrupted it."

"For how long?"

Rowan closed her eyes. She could still feel the System's attention, colder now. Sharper.

"Long enough," she said. "But it cost more than before."

Lio squeezed her hand. "It always does."

Rowan nodded.

The System had learned something else.

Empathy could disrupt containment—but only briefly. Only messily. Only at escalating cost.

And next time, it would be ready.

Some overrides saved the process.

Others just delayed the inevitable.
