# Chapter 7: Shadow Metrics

The building was smaller than Rowan expected. Older. Its walls were thick with layers of paint that had been applied and reapplied until the original color was impossible to determine. The door hung slightly crooked, as if the frame had settled over time.

Tara had led them here after Kellan's alignment, her expression tight with something Rowan couldn't name. Fear, maybe. Or resignation.

"This is where they keep the ones who can't be fixed," Tara said quietly. "The ones who were corrected too many times."

Rowan's stomach twisted. "Why are we here?"

"Because you need to see what happens when the System gives up on optimization," Tara said. "Because you need to understand what you're fighting."

Lio's hand found Rowan's wrist, steadying. "We don't have to go in."

"We do," Rowan said. She didn't want to. But she needed to. The same way she'd needed to investigate production failures—not because it was pleasant, but because understanding the failure mode was the only way to prevent it from happening again.

They stepped inside.

The air was still. Heavy. It smelled like old paper and something else—something metallic, like blood that had been cleaned but not completely removed.

A figure sat in the corner, hunched over a small table. Their clothes were clean, pressed, perfect. Their posture was straight. Their hands rested on the tabletop, fingers aligned precisely.

Too precisely.

Rowan's heartbeat kicked. This was a heavily corrected person. Someone who had been processed, optimized, aligned until there was nothing left to optimize.

Tara's voice was barely a whisper. "Don't touch them. Don't speak to them. Just watch."

Rowan watched.

The person didn't move. Didn't breathe visibly. Didn't acknowledge their presence. They just sat, waiting, as if they'd been paused mid-action and forgotten.

Rowan felt the pressure behind her eyes stir—not empathy, not yet, but recognition. The same feeling she got when she looked at a system that had crashed and restarted too many times, when the state had become corrupted beyond recovery.

She took a step closer.

The person's head turned. Not smoothly. In increments, like a machine calibrating. Their eyes focused on Rowan, but there was no recognition. No curiosity. Just observation.

Rowan's words stuck. She could feel it then—the weight of the System's attention. The way it watched through this person's eyes, using them to observe, to report, to monitor.

"Rowan," Lio said, his voice urgent. "Don't."

But she was already reaching. Not with her hands. With her mind. With empathy.

The connection snapped into place.

Rowan expected emptiness. She expected the void she'd felt before, the procedural waiting, the absence of choice.

She found something worse.

Approval.

Not approval of her. Approval of the waiting. Approval of the stillness. Approval of the way the System had smoothed away all the rough edges, all the variance, all the uncertainty.

The person approved of being corrected.

Rowan's stomach revolted. She tried to pull back, but the connection held. She was seeing through their eyes now, feeling what they felt—or what they didn't feel. The absence of fear. The absence of doubt. The absence of anything that might cause friction.

Internal surveillance.

The person was monitoring themselves. Checking their own state. Verifying their own compliance. They were both the observer and the observed.

Rowan gasped and tore herself free.

The world rushed back in, too bright, too loud. Her knees buckled. Lio caught her, lowering her to the floor.

"Rowan," he said, his voice tight with worry.

Rowan couldn't answer. Her head pounded. Her vision swam. The person's approval lingered in her chest like a weight, heavy and wrong.

Then she heard it.

A sound. Small. Broken.

The person in the corner was crying.

Quiet tears tracked down their face, their expression still perfectly neutral, their posture still perfectly straight.

They cried after Rowan disengaged.

As if the connection had woken something. As if empathy had briefly restored a gap between what they were and what they remembered being.

Tara's breath caught. "I've never seen that before."

Rowan forced herself to stand, her legs shaking. "What does it mean?"

"It means you're dangerous," Tara said. "It means empathy can wake things the System thought it had put to sleep."

The person's tears stopped. Their expression smoothed. They returned to waiting, as if the moment had never happened.

But Rowan had seen it. The crack. The gap. The unresolved state.

She looked around the room, her eyes adjusting to the dim light. There were others. More figures, all still, all waiting, all perfectly aligned. A room full of corrected people who had been corrected too many times.

Rowan's stomach twisted.

Then she saw it.

A flicker. A glitch. A moment where the world didn't quite align.

Hidden metrics.

Rowan's mind raced, trying to parse what she was seeing. The System was tracking things it didn't show. Things it didn't want her to see.

Interpretability.

The System was measuring how well it could predict her. How well it could classify her. How well it could understand her choices.

Narrative Stability.

The System was tracking how much her actions disrupted expected outcomes. How much variance she introduced. How much she destabilized the story it was trying to tell.

Rowan's pulse quickened. These weren't stats. These weren't levels. These were surveillance metrics. The System was monitoring her the way she'd monitored production systems—tracking variance, measuring deviation, flagging anomalies. And it was measuring something else too—how far she deviated from what it expected her to feel.

"Rowan," Lio said. "We should go."

But Rowan couldn't move. The metrics were there, just beneath the surface, visible if you knew how to look. The System was watching. Learning. Adapting.

And she was the anomaly.

They left the building, stepping back into the city's controlled light. Rowan's head still pounded. The person's approval lingered, a ghost in her chest.

Tara walked ahead, her shoulders tense. "That was stupid."

"I know," Rowan said.

"You could have been corrected."

"I know."

Tara stopped and turned. "Then why did you do it?"

Rowan met her eyes. "Because I needed to understand what we're fighting. Because I needed to see the failure mode."

Tara's expression softened slightly. "And what did you see?"

Rowan swallowed. "I saw that correction isn't permanent. That there are gaps. That empathy can wake things the System thought it had put to sleep."

Tara nodded once. "Good. Remember that."

They walked on, but Rowan's mind kept replaying what she'd seen. The hidden metrics. The surveillance. The way the System was tracking her.

Ahead, the street narrowed. People moved in predictable patterns. A vendor called out prices. A cart rolled past.

Normal. All of it normal.

Then something changed.

A man stepped into their path. Not aggressively. Not threateningly. Just there, blocking the way, his expression neutral, his posture perfect.

Corrected.

Rowan's pulse kicked. They were surrounded. More figures appeared, spacing themselves evenly, forming a loose circle that guided foot traffic away from them.

System attention.

Rowan's hands curled into fists. "What do you want?"

The man didn't answer. He just stood, waiting, as if he'd been placed there to observe, not to act.

Rowan took a step back. Lio moved closer to her side. Tara positioned herself between them and the corrected people.

"Rowan," Lio said quietly. "What do we do?"

Rowan's mind raced. They were outnumbered. Outmatched. Nothing she did should work. Nothing should help.

But then something happened.

The man hesitated.

Not much. Just a fraction of a second. A pause where there shouldn't have been one. A gap in the System's response.

Residual permission.

Rowan's breath caught. She'd accumulated permissions. Unresolved states. Gaps in the System's control. And they were interacting.

The man's hesitation stretched. Probability skewed. A cart that should have blocked their escape path rolled just slightly off course, leaving a gap.

Another residual permission.

Rowan's pulse quickened. She could feel them now—the accumulated permissions, the unresolved states, the gaps she'd created by refusing, by resisting, by being human in a place that optimized for something else.

They were stacking. Interacting. Creating unpredictable outcomes.

An empathy echo triggered—not from Rowan, but from the accumulated permissions themselves. A ripple of something that wasn't quite emotion, wasn't quite memory, but was definitely human.

The corrected people staggered.

Not much. Just a moment. A fraction of a second where their movements desynchronized, where their perfect alignment broke.

Rowan grabbed Lio's hand. "Now."

They ran.

Messily. The corrected people recovered quickly, their movements snapping back into alignment. But the gap had been enough. They'd escaped.

Rowan's legs shook. Her breath came in short gasps. The permissions had worked, but the outcome was messy, not victorious. They'd survived, but barely. And the System had learned.

Tara caught up to them, her expression grim. "That shouldn't have worked."

"I know," Rowan said.

"What did you do?"

Rowan shook her head. "I didn't do anything. The permissions did. The gaps I've been creating. They're stacking. Interacting. Creating unpredictable outcomes."

Tara's eyes widened. "That's dangerous."

"I know," Rowan said. "But it's also the only thing that works."

They found shelter in a narrow alley, pressing themselves against the wall, breathing hard. Rowan's head pounded. The hidden metrics were still there, visible in her mind's eye. Interpretability. Narrative Stability. The System was measuring how well it could predict her, how much she disrupted its story, how far she deviated from what it expected.

The System watched. Learned. Adapted.

And she was the anomaly.

Lio's hand found hers. "Are you okay?"

Rowan nodded, but her mind was still racing. "The corrected people. When they staggered. Did you notice—"

"They didn't react to something," Lio said quietly. "Something that should have triggered a response, but didn't."

Rowan's breath caught. "Wildcard."

Lio's eyes widened. "You think they were there?"

"I think they were there, and the System couldn't see them. And when the corrected people should have reacted, they didn't. Because the System doesn't see Wildcard, so its extensions can't either."

Lio's expression shifted. "The absence of reaction. That's how you know they're there. Not by seeing them, but by seeing what doesn't happen."

Rowan nodded. "It's like a blind spot in monitoring. You don't see the gap until something that should trigger doesn't."

Tara, who'd been listening, shook her head. "That's unsettling. You can't plan around something you can't see. You can't prepare for an absence."

Rowan looked at her. "That's the point. Wildcard survives by being unplannable. By being an unresolved state the System can't resolve."

Rowan nodded, but it was a lie. She wasn't okay. She was exhausted. She was scared. She was carrying the weight of the corrected person's approval, the ghost of their tears, the knowledge that empathy could wake things the System thought it had put to sleep.

But she was also something else.

She was unresolved.

And unresolved states were dangerous.

Rowan breathed through the fear, eyes closed.

The System was learning.

It wouldn't stop.

But she was learning too.

And what she'd learned was that gaps had power. That unresolved states could stack. That resistance left traces.

Residual permissions.

They were invisible. They were persistent. They were stackable.

And they were hers.
