## Map Placement Instructions

**For the final book layout:**

Place the city map on a right-hand page (recto) immediately after the title page. This ensures:
- Map is visible when reader opens the book
- Map can be referenced throughout reading
- Map doesn't interrupt the narrative flow
- Map sets the stage for the city's importance

**If using a two-page spread:**
- Left page: Map
- Right page: Map (continued) or blank with map caption

**If using a single page:**
- Full-page map with caption below or on facing page

## Map Caption Text

Use this caption for the map:

> *The city is organized for efficiency. The System prefers clean geometries, predictable routes, and clear boundaries. Every district serves a purpose. Every wall contains. Every watchtower observes.*
>
> *Rowan's camp lies one mile outside the containment wall—close enough to observe, far enough to remain illegible. For now.*

## Alternative: Map in Back Matter

If preferred, the map could also be placed:
- At the end of the book (before or after epilogue)
- As a fold-out map
- As a separate insert

However, **front placement is recommended** because:
- Readers can reference it during key scenes
- It establishes the city's importance immediately
- It helps with spatial understanding throughout the book
