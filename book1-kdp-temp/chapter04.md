# Chapter 4
## Deviation Detected

The person—Lio, they'd said, voice shaking—stumbled backward until their spine hit the wall and slid down. Their breathing came in short, panicked gasps. They wrapped their arms around their knees and rocked slightly, like they were trying to contain something that wanted to escape.

Rowan stayed where she was, hands still raised, watching.

The system's pressure had eased when she'd stepped closer to Lio, as if the presence of someone who could see the overlay diluted the effect. But it hadn't vanished. Rowan could feel it still, a low-grade hum at the edge of her perception, like a bad audio driver that refused to quit.

Lio's eyes darted between Rowan and the door, wild and unfocused. "I'm trying," they whispered, voice cracking. "I'm trying to get to the door. But it— it hurts—"

Rowan's jaw tightened.

The system wasn't just punishing disobedience. It was punishing struggle.

She lowered her hands slowly. "Lio. Can you look at me?"

Lio flinched, head snapping up. Their eyes met Rowan's, then skittered away again. "I can't— I can't see—"

"The text," Rowan finished. "I know."

"You can see it?" Lio's voice was raw with something that might have been hope, or might have been despair. "The— the messages?"

"Sometimes," Rowan said carefully. "Sometimes I can. And sometimes I can see when it's—" She stopped, searching for the right word. "When it's pushing."

Lio's shoulders hunched. "It's always pushing."

Rowan felt something cold settle in her chest. "Always?"

"It never stops." Lio's voice dropped to a whisper. "It's like— like having a headache that gets worse every time you think about leaving. About not doing what it wants. And you don't even know what it wants, not really, you just feel it, and the more you feel it the harder it is to think, and—"

They cut off, choking on the words.

Rowan stared at the floating text in her vision. It showed nothing about Lio. No status. No warnings. Just her own PATH STATUS: ACTIVE and OBJECTIVE PROGRESS: MEASURABLE.

She looked at the door, then back at Lio.

This was the test.

The system had put an objective in front of her—reach the door—and then placed a person in her path. Someone who was suffering. Someone who needed help. Someone who would slow her down.

The optimal choice was clear: leave them behind. Move forward. Survive.

Rowan had done optimal before. She'd optimized code paths and database queries and deployment pipelines. She'd optimized for uptime and performance and cost.

She'd also seen what optimization did to people.

The team lead who optimized away the manual testing phase to hit a deadline, and then spent six months fixing bugs in production. The manager who optimized headcount by cutting the documentation team, and then watched three new engineers waste a month trying to understand the codebase. The company that optimized profits by cutting corners on security, and then spent millions cleaning up a data breach.

People were systems. Systems were people. The principle held.

But people weren't code paths. You couldn't optimize them like variables. And you definitely couldn't optimize away their pain and pretend it didn't exist.

Rowan exhaled slowly.

"Okay," she said. "Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to help you get to the door. And then we're going to walk through it together. And if the system doesn't like that, it can send me a strongly worded email."

Lio stared at her, wide-eyed. "You— you'd do that?"

"I'm about to," Rowan said. "So you should probably decide if you want to accept the help, because I'm doing it either way."

That was mostly true. Rowan wasn't entirely sure Lio had the capacity to refuse right now, not with the system's pressure grinding them down. But it felt important to offer the choice. To make it clear this wasn't conditional.

Lio's shoulders trembled. They opened their mouth, closed it, then nodded once, sharp and jerky.

Rowan moved slowly, careful not to startle them. She crouched down, ignoring the protest from her ankle, and reached out a hand. "Come on. Up we go."

Lio reached for her hand, fingers shaking. Their grip was weak, cold, but they held on.

Rowan pulled them to their feet, steadying them when they swayed. Lio was shorter than her, thin in a way that suggested hunger rather than build. Their clothes were torn and stained, same as hers. Their face was pale, smudged with dirt and something that might have been dried tears.

The moment Lio was standing, the system's pressure sharpened.

Not on Rowan.

On Lio.

Rowan watched, horrified, as Lio's face contorted with pain. They flinched, gasping, and would have fallen if Rowan hadn't tightened her grip.

"Don't let go," Lio whispered. "Please. Don't—"

"I won't," Rowan said, voice harder than she meant. "I'm not letting go."

They shuffled forward together, slow and unsteady. Each step made Lio wince. Rowan could feel them shaking against her side.

Three steps. Five. Ten.

The floating text in Rowan's vision flickered.

Then it updated.

Rowan stared at the words, chest tight.

It wasn't just watching outcomes. It was watching decisions.

It had seen her choose to help Lio, and it had logged that choice as deviation. Not because they'd failed. Not because they'd died. Just because the choice itself was inefficient.

Rowan's mouth went dry.

This wasn't a dungeon system that punished failure. This was a system that punished humanity.

She forced herself to keep moving, one step at a time, Lio leaning heavily against her. The door loomed ahead, the carved symbol still faintly glowing where she'd touched it.

Five more steps. Three. One.

Rowan reached out with her free hand and pressed her palm against the door's surface.

The stone warmed beneath her touch. The symbol brightened. The seam began to open.

Lio made a small, desperate sound and pressed closer to Rowan's side.

"It's okay," Rowan said, voice steady despite the cold fear coiling in her stomach. "We're going through together."

The door opened wider. Darkness waited beyond.

Rowan looked at Lio, at their pale face and wide, terrified eyes.

Then she looked back at the floating text.

DEVIATION: CONFIRMED

Rowan met the empty air with a hard, angry smile.

"Noted," she said quietly. "Now watch this."

She stepped forward, pulling Lio with her, and together they crossed the threshold into the darkness beyond.
