# Chapter 3
## Undocumented Mechanics

The tunnel sloped downward and then—without warning—didn’t.

It became stairs.

Not carved with care. Not engineered. Just a series of uneven stone steps cut into the rock as if someone had started a staircase and then gotten bored halfway through, leaving the rest to be implied.

Rowan descended slowly, bracing her hand against the wall. The glow-veins grew brighter here, pulsing faintly in patterns that felt almost like a heartbeat.

She didn’t like how alive the stone seemed.

Her ankle screamed every third step. Her arm burned where the creature’s claws had torn her skin. Somewhere deeper in her ribs, something was bruised in a way that made each breath a little too conscious.

Rowan kept moving anyway.

Because the system had defined failure as stagnation, and she refused to die because of a semantic trap.

The floating text stayed with her.

Not in front of her, not blocking her view—just… present. A layer in her perception.

Rowan tried to ignore it for three minutes, then failed.

She had spent too many years staring at dashboards to let one exist in her vicinity without interrogating it. Three days debugging a Grafana panel that showed metrics from the wrong Prometheus instance, all because someone had changed the datasource config and not updated the docs. Old habits died hard. Especially when they kept you alive.

“Okay,” she said softly. “Let’s test.”

She stopped on a step and stood still.

No message appeared. No penalty struck.

Rowan counted silently.

Ten seconds. Twenty. Thirty.

Still nothing.

She exhaled through her nose.

“Not a timeout,” she murmured. “Not immediate.”

She took one step down. Then another.

The tug in her attention eased slightly, like a tension line relaxing.

“Directional reinforcement,” she said, mostly to herself. “Not control.”

She paused again, longer this time, and watched for changes.

The floating text remained unchanged.

So Rowan did what she’d always done with systems that refused to provide documentation.

She probed the edges.

She took one step up.

The tug sharpened immediately. Not pain. Not force. Just… disapproval.

Rowan’s skin prickled.

The floating text updated with a single new line.

PROGRESS REGRESSION DETECTED

Rowan stared at it.

“Yeah,” she said, voice dry. “That’s what up is.”

She took another step up.

The tug became heavier, like trying to walk with wet clothes clinging to her. Her thoughts felt slightly more difficult to hold in a straight line, like the system was adding friction to her cognition.

Not enough to stop her. Enough to discourage.

Rowan’s mouth tightened.

“Okay,” she whispered. “So that’s how you do it.”

She stepped back down and the friction eased.

Rowan stood still for a moment, letting the realization settle.

This wasn’t a quest marker. It was behavioral shaping.

The system didn’t need to control her body if it could alter the cost of disobedience at the level of attention, perception, and fatigue.

That was… elegant.

That was also horrifying.

Rowan forced herself to breathe slowly.

“Correction through incentives,” she muttered. “Like a product team designed by a sadist.”

She continued down the stairs.

They went longer than they should have. Not in a magical infinite way—just in a way that made her sense of distance unreliable. Rowan tried to count steps and lost track twice, which annoyed her more than it should have.

You’re tired, she told herself. Injured. Bleeding. That’s all.

But she couldn’t shake the feeling that the stairs were… shifting. Subtly changing height when she wasn’t looking, nudging her foot placement into patterns.

Rowan stopped and pressed her palm to the wall. The stone was warm.

Not sunlight warm. Body warm.

She pulled her hand back quickly, stomach turning.

“Nope,” she said. “Don’t like that. Don’t like that at all.”

A faint sound drifted up from below—murmurs, maybe. Or wind threading through stone.

Rowan moved again, faster now, driven by the uncomfortable truth that staying still might count as stagnation and moving might lead her to something worse.

At the base of the stairs, the tunnel opened into a wider passage, then into a chamber.

This one wasn’t a cavern. It was a room.

It had walls, straight lines, corners that suggested intentional design. The floor was smoother, swept clean of dust. The glow-veins here formed a lattice, a geometric pattern that made Rowan’s eyes itch.

In the center of the room stood a pedestal.

On it: a bowl filled with water so still it looked like black glass.

Rowan stopped at the threshold.

Every instinct she had—human and genre-aware—screamed trap.

She stared at the bowl and then at the floating text. It had not updated. Not a single prompt to interact, no instructions, no helpful “press here” icon.

Rowan’s jaw flexed.

"Undocumented feature," she said. Like that passive-aggressive coworker who'd add features to the API without updating the docs and then get surprised when everyone broke production. "Thanks, Greg. Really appreciate the heads-up."

She took a step into the room.

Nothing happened.

Another step.

Still nothing.

Rowan approached the pedestal slowly, circling it. The bowl’s surface reflected her face in warped darkness—pale, smeared with blood and dust, eyes too bright with adrenaline.

She leaned closer.

The reflection didn’t match her movement exactly. It lagged by a fraction, as if the water was rendering her with delay.

Rowan’s skin crawled.

“Okay,” she whispered. “That’s either magic or I’m concussed.”

She lifted a finger and touched the water.

Cold shocked her fingertip.

The surface rippled.

And a new line appeared in her vision, faint at first, then sharpening into readable text.

STABILITY CREDIT: AVAILABLE
CONDITION: CONFIRM IDENTITY

Rowan froze.

Her finger was still in the water. The cold bit deeper, spreading up her hand like numbness.

“Confirm identity,” she repeated. “To what end?”

The system did not answer.

Rowan pulled her finger out of the bowl and wiped it on her pants, as if that could remove the feeling of being observed.

Her reflection in the water stared back at her a moment longer than it should have, then stilled.

Rowan swallowed.

This is a checkpoint, she thought. Or a login.

And if it was a login, then whatever she did here might give the system more access.

Rowan stared at the offer of a Stability Credit and felt her body argue for it. Her ankle hurt. Her blood loss made her head light. A minor stabilization could mean the difference between walking and crawling.

But she didn’t trust free resources from systems that shaped behavior.

She had learned that lesson in tech and in life.

Rowan took a slow breath.

“Okay,” she said quietly. “We’re doing this like a security review.”

She looked around the room.

There, carved into the far wall, was a door.

Not a wooden fantasy door. Not iron. Stone, seamless, with a faint outline around it like it could open if it decided to acknowledge you.

The first door.

Rowan’s heart thudded.

She glanced back at the bowl.

“Of course,” she said. “Of course you put the incentive next to the objective.”

She stepped away from the pedestal and toward the door, limping, gaze fixed on the outline in the stone.

The floating text nudged at the edge of her vision, directional weight tightening.

Rowan ignored it and placed her palm against the door.

The stone was warm, again. Alive-warm.

She pressed harder.

Nothing happened.

Rowan frowned, then slid her hand along the outline, searching for a seam, a latch, any physical affordance.

Her fingers caught on a shallow groove—an etching, barely visible.

A symbol.

It wasn’t a letter. It wasn’t a rune she recognized. It was something like a spiral intersected by straight lines, a geometry that made her eyes want to unfocus.

Rowan traced it once.

The glow-veins in the wall brightened, pulsing in response.

The floating text updated immediately.

OBJECTIVE PROGRESS: MEASURABLE
PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS: 18%

Rowan stared.

“Measurable,” she said flatly. “Because I touched your weird sigil.”

A faint sound came from behind her—footsteps, hurried and uneven.

Rowan turned sharply, pain flaring in her ankle, and raised her hands instinctively.

Movement in the corridor beyond—not one person. Two.

A young man, maybe early twenties, supporting someone else. An older woman, his mother maybe, her arm slung over his shoulders, her face pale and drawn. Blood stained the side of her shirt, dark and spreading.

They stumbled into the room together, the young man's eyes wide with desperation.

"Please," he gasped. "Help. She's hurt. Something—something got her—"

Rowan's stomach tightened. "Who are you?"

"Jace," the young man said, voice cracking. "This is my mom, Elena. We fell—we fell together. Please—"

The woman—Elena—groaned, her eyes fluttering. She was barely conscious, her breathing shallow.

Rowan stepped forward, then stopped. Her overlay hadn't updated. No system response. No warnings. Nothing.

That was wrong.

She looked at Jace, at the desperation in his eyes, at the way he held his mother like she was the only thing keeping him from falling apart.

This was the system's test, again. Help them, or move on.

Jace's eyes flicked to the pedestal, then to Rowan. "Can you—can you see—"

Rowan cut him off. "The text? Yes. Can you?"

Jace shook his head, confused. "Text? What text? I just—I just feel like I need to get to the door. Like something's pushing. Please, help us first, then we can—"

Elena coughed, blood flecking her lips.

Rowan's jaw clenched. The system was using them. Making them a distraction. Making them a choice.

But they were real people. Real people who needed help.

She moved toward them, but Jace flinched back, pulling his mother with him.

"Wait," he said. "You're—you're hurt too. Your ankle—"

Rowan stopped. "I'll manage. Let me look at her."

Jace hesitated, then nodded, lowering Elena gently to the floor. Rowan knelt beside them, ignoring the protest from her own injuries.

Elena's wound was bad. A deep gash along her ribs, still bleeding. Not fresh, but not old either. Whatever had done this, it had been recent.

"How long ago?" Rowan asked.

"Maybe an hour?" Jace's voice shook. "We were running. Something was chasing us. It caught her. I managed to—to hit it with a rock, and we ran. But she's getting worse."

Rowan pressed her hand against the wound, applying pressure. Elena gasped, her eyes opening slightly.

"Jace," she whispered.

"I'm here, Mom. I'm here."

Rowan looked at the door, then back at Elena. She could help them get to the door. Could try to stabilize Elena. But it would slow her down. And the system would count that as deviation.

She looked at Jace. "Can you carry her?"

Jace nodded, though his arms were already shaking from exhaustion. "Yes. I can."

Rowan stood. "Then we're getting you to the door. Together."

Jace's eyes filled with tears. "Thank you. Thank you so much."

But as they moved toward the door, Rowan felt the system's pressure increase—not on her, but on Jace and Elena. They flinched, both of them, as if struck by an invisible weight.

"Jace," Elena whispered. "It hurts. It hurts so much."

Jace's face contorted with pain. "I know, Mom. Just—just hold on."

Rowan watched them struggle under the system's influence, and felt cold fury settle in her chest. The system was punishing them for being vulnerable. For needing help. For existing.

They reached the door, but Elena's breathing had grown more labored. Rowan knew, with terrible certainty, that Elena wasn't going to make it much further. Not without proper medical care. And the system wasn't going to provide that.

Jace must have realized it too, because he looked at Rowan with desperate hope. "Is there—is there anything you can do? At the pedestal? Maybe—"

Rowan shook her head. "The pedestal is a trap. Taking from it makes things worse."

"But she'll die!" Jace's voice broke. "My mom will die!"

Rowan's throat tightened. "I know. But taking from the system won't save her. It'll just make you pay for it later."

Jace stared at her, tears streaming down his face. "Then what do I do?"

Rowan met his gaze. "You choose. Help her now, or keep yourself safe. The system wants you to think there's only one right answer. But there isn't. There's just choice. And consequence."

Jace looked down at his mother, at her pale face, at the blood still seeping from her wound. Then he looked back at Rowan.

"I choose her," he said, voice firm despite the tears. "Always."

Rowan nodded. "Then I'll help you get to the door. After that—"

She didn't finish. Didn't need to.

They moved toward the door, Jace supporting Elena, Rowan limping beside them. The system's pressure increased with each step, but Jace didn't stop. Didn't give in.

They reached the door. Rowan pressed her palm against the symbol, and it began to open.

"Go," she said to Jace. "Quickly."

Jace looked at her, then nodded. "Thank you. For—for everything."

He and Elena passed through the door together, disappearing into the darkness beyond.

Rowan watched them go, her chest tight with a grief she didn't have time for.

The door began to close.

A faint sound came from behind her—footsteps, hurried and uneven.

Rowan turned sharply, pain flaring in her ankle, and raised her hands instinctively.

A figure stumbled into the room.

Human.

Barely.

They were thin, clothes torn and stained, hair matted with sweat. Their eyes were wide, frantic, darting between Rowan, the pedestal, and the door.

They froze when they saw her.

Then, in a voice raw with fear, they said, “Don’t—don’t touch that.”

Rowan kept her hands up, palms open.

“Too late,” she said. “But I’m open to feedback.”

The person swallowed hard. Their gaze flicked to the floating text in Rowan’s vision—except their eyes didn’t track it. They were looking through her, not at it.

Rowan's stomach tightened.

They can't see it.

Rowan didn’t have time to process that before the person stumbled forward another step and the system responded.

Not with text.

With a shift in the air.

A pressure.

The room seemed to inhale.

Rowan’s skin prickled.

The newcomer flinched as if struck.

Rowan watched, horrified, as their posture changed—shoulders slumping, eyes unfocusing. Like someone had reached into their mind and increased the weight of existing despair.

“Please,” the person whispered, voice breaking. “I’m— I’m trying. I’m trying to make it to the door.”

Rowan’s hands curled into fists.

Corrective influence, she thought grimly. Dormant for me. Not for them.

And the system had not warned her.

It had just… applied pressure to the easiest target.

Rowan took a slow breath.

“Okay,” she said softly. “Okay. I’m Rowan. I don’t know where we are. But I know what this is.”

The person blinked at her, confused.

Rowan glanced at the pedestal.

Then back to the person.

She made a decision.

An inefficient one.

But she’d already accepted she was going to make those.
