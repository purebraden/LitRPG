# Chapter 1
## The Failure Event

Rowan Mercer knew she was going to die because the ground gave way beneath her feet and there was no warning.

No rumble. No cinematic pause. One moment she was stepping forward, thinking about whether she’d left the stove on—she hadn’t, she never did—and the next moment the world dropped out from under her like a bad assumption.

She fell.

The air tore past her ears. Her stomach lurched with the certainty that this was terminal, that there was no branch to grab, no ledge, no miracle hiding in latency. Just gravity doing what it always did when allowed.

Okay, she thought, distantly. That’s… unfortunate.

She hit stone hard enough to knock the breath from her lungs and the lights from her vision. Pain flared everywhere at once, sharp and unsorted, like an alert storm with no deduplication. Her ribs screamed. Her shoulder burned. Her ankle twisted at an angle that made her stomach revolt.

Rowan lay there, gasping, staring up at a ceiling that did not belong to any building she recognized.

It was dark stone, rough-hewn and uneven, threaded with faint veins of something that glowed a dim blue, like bioluminescence struggling to be relevant. Dust drifted down in lazy spirals, catching the light.

She tried to move. Her body disagreed loudly.

“Okay,” she croaked, to no one. “Okay, that’s… that’s new.”

She cataloged damage automatically. Breathing hurt but was possible. Fingers moved. Toes on the right foot responded. Left ankle screamed in protest and then went ominously quiet.

Not ideal.

Rowan closed her eyes and waited for panic.

It didn’t come.

What came instead was a familiar, weary clarity—the same mental state she'd hit during production outages, when the alarms were screaming and the dashboards were on fire and someone, somewhere, was already drafting the wrong postmortem. That time the payment system went down at 2 AM and she'd spent three hours debugging database cluster failures while half the engineering team tried to deploy fixes that made everything worse. Friday afternoon deploys that broke everything right before the weekend. The incident where the API gateway decided to route all traffic to a dead service and no one noticed until customer complaints flooded in.

This was just another incident. Different context. Same principle.

You didn't panic then. You assessed. You stabilized. You survived.

She pushed herself up on one elbow and immediately regretted it.

The space around her resolved slowly. A cavern, wide and low-ceilinged, carved by hand or something that wanted to pretend it was a hand. The walls were etched with shallow grooves, spirals and lines that meant nothing to her but still felt… intentional. Like someone had decorated with purpose and then forgotten why.

There was no exit she could see. Just darkness beyond the glow-veined stone.

Rowan swallowed and tasted blood.

“This is not,” she said, voice echoing weakly, “a concussion dream.”

She had read enough fantasy to know better than to assume that.

Isekai was a genre built on false confidence.

She stayed still, listening.

There were sounds—distant, irregular. A scraping, maybe. Stone against stone. Or claws. Or something breathing in a way that suggested it had more lungs than it strictly needed.

Rowan exhaled slowly.

All right, she thought. If this is happening, it’s happening.

Her mind reached automatically for structure. What had come before the fall? She’d been walking. Sidewalk. Late afternoon. The sun low, the air cold with the promise of winter. She’d been thinking about a deploy scheduled for Monday and whether the new monitoring thresholds were going to false-positive themselves into oblivion.

Normal.

And now this.

No truck. No blinding light. No voice proclaiming destiny.

Just a fall. Just pain.

Which, frankly, worried her more.

She dragged herself backward until her spine hit the cavern wall and slid down, careful of her ankle. Her hands brushed over something damp and sticky. She froze, heart hammering, then realized with a wave of disgust that it was blood. Not all of it hers.

Rowan’s breath hitched.

She forced herself to look.

The body lay half in shadow a few feet away, twisted unnaturally, limbs bent where joints should not bend. Its skin—grayish, almost translucent—was marked with the same faint blue glow as the walls, concentrated along veins that pulsed weakly and then stilled.

Humanoid. Mostly.

Very dead.

“Oh,” Rowan whispered. “That’s… worse.”

She stared at it, mind racing.

If this was a dungeon—and yes, her brain had gone there immediately—then the presence of a corpse implied a few things. One, she wasn’t the first thing dropped here. Two, survival was not guaranteed. Three—

The scraping sound grew louder.

Closer.

Rowan pushed herself flat against the wall, every nerve alight. She scanned the ground frantically and spotted a jagged shard of stone within reach. She grabbed it with shaking fingers and held it out in front of her like it might matter.

Okay. Okay. Okay.

She had no magic. No weapons. No system notifications cheerfully explaining her options. Just pain, a corpse, and something moving in the dark.

The scraping resolved into a shape.

It was low to the ground, jointed in too many places, its body a series of armored plates that clicked softly as it moved. Pale eyes—too many of them—caught the glow from the walls and reflected it back, bright and hungry.

Rowan’s grip tightened on the stone shard.

“Hey,” she said, stupidly. “Let’s not do this.”

The thing lunged.

She screamed—not in terror, but in fury—and swung the shard with everything she had.

It connected. The stone cracked against armor and shattered, sending shards flying. The creature recoiled, hissing, more surprised than hurt.

Rowan didn’t wait.

She shoved herself forward, ignoring the agony in her ankle, and slammed her weight into the creature’s side. They rolled together across the cavern floor. Claws raked her arm. She felt skin tear and blood spill warm and slick.

She grabbed blindly and found a groove in the creature’s plating, pried with her fingers, tore until something gave.

The thing shrieked, a thin, piercing sound that set her teeth on edge.

Rowan slammed her fist down again and again, breath ragged, vision tunneling.

The creature convulsed and then went still.

Silence rushed in, thick and oppressive.

Rowan collapsed back against the stone, shaking violently.

She laughed once, a sharp, hysterical bark that echoed off the walls and sounded wrong in her ears.

"Okay," she gasped. "Okay. So. Not dead."

Her laughter turned into a cough. Blood spattered the floor.

I should have called in sick today, she thought, absurdly. This was definitely a valid excuse.

Her vision blurred. The creature's body lay sprawled nearby, one of its many eyes still staring, unblinking. The armor plating had cracked where she'd hit it. Dark fluid oozed from the wound. She'd done that. With a rock. And her bare hands.

Her arm throbbed where the claws had caught her. Blood ran down her wrist, warm and sticky. She needed to stop the bleeding, but moving seemed like an unreasonable demand right now.

Her body shook—adrenaline crash, probably. Or blood loss. Or both. The stone beneath her felt cold against her back. The creature's blood was already congealing.

She forced herself to sit up, head spinning. The cavern swam. Her ankle screamed in protest. Not broken, maybe. Sprained, definitely. She could still feel it, which was both a relief and a curse.

With shaking hands, she tore a strip from the bottom of her shirt—already bloodied, already ruined—and wrapped it clumsily around her arm. The fabric was thin, cheap, meant for office air conditioning, not dungeon survival. It would have to do.

The knot was lopsided. The pressure made her arm pulse with pain. Good. Pain meant she was still connected. Still present.

Her vision blurred again.

She felt herself tipping, consciousness slipping like a bad connection.

And then—

The message appeared.

Three seconds too late.

PATH ASSIGNMENT: PENDING

The words floated in the air above her, stark and colorless, utterly unconcerned with the blood pooling beneath them.

Rowan stared at them through dimming vision and thought, very calmly, You are so far behind.

Darkness took her before the message could say anything else.
