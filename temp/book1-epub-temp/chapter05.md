# Chapter 5
## Companion Zero

The seam in the door widened like a hesitant breath.

Stone did not swing the way wood did. It didn’t creak. It didn’t announce itself. The line of light simply expanded until there was a gap wide enough for a person to slip through, and beyond it the darkness looked… different. Less like absence, more like depth.

Rowan kept her hand on Lio’s arm.

“You go first,” she said.

Lio’s eyes went huge. “What? No. You— you can see the— the—”

“I can see a system overlay,” Rowan said, keeping her voice steady. “That doesn’t make me immune to whatever is on the other side. Go first so I can pull you back if you fall.”

That was mostly true. It also meant the system would have to watch Lio cross the threshold before it watched Rowan do the same, and Rowan wanted whatever data it gathered to be imperfect.

Lio swallowed hard and nodded.

They stepped forward.

The moment Lio’s shoulder crossed the seam, the air pressure changed. Not wind. Not temperature. It felt like walking through a scanner, the kind that pretended to be passive while it measured every part of you.

Lio stiffened. Their breath hitched.

Rowan tightened her grip. “Keep going.”

Lio stumbled through.

Rowan followed immediately, refusing to give the system the satisfaction of an isolated crossing.

On the other side, the light from the seam dimmed and then vanished as the door slid shut behind them, sealing with a soft, final click.

Rowan found herself in a corridor that looked like it had been built to impress someone. The walls were smooth and dark, cut into gentle curves that guided the eye forward. The glow-veins here were deliberate, arranged in parallel lines like runway lights.

It was the first place she'd seen in this world that felt like design.

It was either safe or an ambush. And Rowan had lived long enough to know those were often the same thing.

She scanned quickly. No creatures. No corpses. No obvious traps. The corridor stretched ahead and then curved out of sight.

Lio leaned against the wall and slid down, shaking.

Rowan crouched beside them, careful of her ankle. “Hey. Look at me.”

Lio blinked, eyes unfocused.

Rowan forced her voice into calm competence. “Name three things you can see.”

Lio stared at her like she’d spoken another language.

Rowan softened slightly. “Just… humor me.”

Lio swallowed. “The… lights. Your… your face. The— the—” Their gaze flicked to the corridor. “The walls.”

“Good,” Rowan said. “Now, breathe. In. Out.”

Lio’s breath shuddered, but it followed her pacing.

Rowan’s own body was still screaming. She could feel blood crusting on her arm. Her ankle throbbed with each heartbeat. But she’d learned during outages that if you had two failing components, you prioritized the one that would take the whole system down if it collapsed.

Right now, that was Lio.

Rowan looked up and caught her own reflection in the polished stone wall. It was faint, distorted, and it made her look like someone else—someone older and harder.

The system text hovered at the edge of her vision, quiet.

Rowan did not look at it.

She focused on Lio. “Tell me what happened before you got here.”

Lio flinched. “I— I was at work. I was— I was carrying boxes. I blinked and— and I was falling.”

Rowan’s stomach tightened.

“Same,” she said, but kept her voice neutral. “Anyone say anything to you? Any… voice? Any instructions?”

Lio shook their head rapidly. “Nothing. Just— just falling. And then the stairs. And then… the feeling. Like I was wrong. Like I didn’t fit.”

Rowan’s jaw clenched.

Wrong. Didn’t fit. That sounded like the system’s judgment masquerading as reality.

Rowan glanced down at Lio’s side. Their shirt was torn; beneath it, a bruise was blooming along their ribs, dark and ugly.

Rowan pulled the strip of membrane she’d scavenged from the creature out of her pocket and offered it. “Tie it tighter around your ribs. It’ll help.”

Lio took it with hands that trembled. “What is this?”

Rowan considered lying.

She didn’t. “A thing I killed.”

Lio stared at her like she’d revealed a secret.

Rowan shrugged. “It tried to kill me first.”

Lio’s lips parted. “How did you…?”

Rowan hesitated.

Because the honest answer was: with luck and stubbornness and the kind of desperation you only got when systems failed and you had no backup.

She settled for something truer. “I didn’t have a better option.”

Lio’s hands tightened on the membrane. They tied it around their ribs clumsily, then winced as it tightened.

Rowan nodded. “Good. Now. We need a plan.”

Lio stared at her, eyes wet. “I don’t want to die.”

Rowan looked at them, and for a moment she saw herself—young, exhausted, terrified of failure because failure had always cost her something.

“Then we don’t,” Rowan said.

Her voice didn’t leave room for argument.

Lio blinked as if they couldn’t quite process the certainty.

Rowan pushed herself to her feet. Pain lanced up her leg. She gritted her teeth.

The corridor ahead hummed faintly, like the stone itself had a current running through it.

Rowan took one step, then another.

The tug in her attention returned—but subtler than before. Less directional, more… anticipatory.

As if something ahead would register as progress.

Rowan walked, and Lio followed at her side, staying close enough that their sleeves brushed.

They reached the curve in the corridor and turned.

Beyond it was a chamber—larger than the room with the bowl, but not cavernous. This one had benches carved into the walls, shallow alcoves with bundles of cloth, and in the center a pillar with a carved panel that looked like it wanted to be an interface.

Rowan slowed.

“Rest stop,” she said quietly.

Lio’s voice was thin. “Or trap.”

“Both,” Rowan agreed.

Rowan approached the pillar.

The carved panel was smooth, with the same spiral-and-line symbol embedded near the top. Beneath it were shallow grooves that formed a grid—like a control surface designed by someone who’d heard of buttons but hated the concept.

Rowan did not touch it immediately.

She stood still, scanning the room. The benches were too clean for a place that housed desperate survivors. The bundles of cloth were arranged like offerings. In one alcove, a clay jug sat with a cup beside it.

Provisioning.

Rowan’s mouth went tight.

It was generosity that wanted something in return.

Lio moved toward the bundles like a starving person toward food.

Rowan caught their wrist. “Don’t.”

Lio’s eyes flashed. “Why not? It’s— it’s supplies.”

“It’s bait,” Rowan said, voice low. “And if it isn’t, it’s still a contract. We don’t sign contracts we haven’t read.”

Lio swallowed. "You… you talk like my manager."

Rowan huffed a dry laugh. "That's because your manager was trying to keep the budget alive. This thing is trying to keep something else alive. And it's not us."

The Black Friday incident came to mind—the API gateway team and the database team both prioritizing their own systems while customers couldn't check out. People were systems. Systems were people. The principle held.

Rowan let go of Lio’s wrist, but she didn’t step away.

She approached the pillar and finally looked at the system overlay.

It had updated without her noticing.

PATH: THE STAIR THAT DOES NOT END
OBJECTIVE: REACH THE FIRST DOOR
STATUS: COMPLETE
REWARD: STABILITY CREDIT (MINOR) — PENDING CLAIM
NOTE: CLAIM AVAILABLE AT DESIGNATED NODE

Rowan stared at the phrase DESIGNATED NODE and then at the pillar.

“Of course,” she murmured.

Lio watched her face. “What is it?”

Rowan didn’t answer directly. “Do you feel anything when you look at that pillar?”

Lio hesitated. “Like… like it wants me to touch it. Like if I don’t, I’m wasting time.”

Rowan’s skin prickled.

“That’s the same thing I feel,” Rowan said. “But mine comes with text.”

Lio’s shoulders sagged. “So you’re… special.”

Rowan flinched at the word.

“No,” she said sharply. “I’m visible. There’s a difference.”

She stared at the pillar’s panel.

Claiming the Stability Credit might reduce pain. Might stop bleeding. Might keep her from passing out halfway through the next corridor. It might also give the system deeper access, more leverage, more influence.

Rowan pressed her tongue to her teeth.

Then she did what she always did when faced with a risky deployment.

She staged it.

Rowan turned to Lio. “We’re going to test it.”

Lio looked like they wanted to cry again. “How?”

Rowan pointed at the bundles. “You don’t touch anything. Not yet. You stand by the door we came in through. If something changes in your head, if you get that ‘give up’ feeling, you tell me immediately.”

Lio swallowed. “And if I can’t?”

Rowan held their gaze. “Then I’ll know anyway.”

Lio shuddered and nodded.

Rowan approached the pillar and placed her palm on the panel.

The moment her skin touched stone, the room brightened. The glow-veins flared, and something like a pulse ran through the floor.

Text snapped into her vision—clean and cold.

CLAIM REWARD: STABILITY CREDIT (MINOR)
CONFIRM CLAIM: YES / NO

Rowan stared at the YES/NO like it was a trapdoor.

She took a slow breath and scanned her body for changes. Pain was still pain. The tug in her attention tightened slightly.

Rowan glanced at Lio.

Lio was rigid, eyes wide, breathing fast.

“Lio,” Rowan said. “Talk.”

Lio swallowed. “It’s… louder. The feeling.”

Rowan’s jaw clenched.

The system was pushing on Lio the moment Rowan engaged with the node.

It was trying to make her trade Lio’s stability for her own.

Rowan felt anger settle in her bones.

“No,” she whispered.

Then she lifted her other hand off the panel and stepped away, breaking contact.

The glow dimmed.

The pressure eased.

Lio sagged, panting. “Why did it do that?”

Rowan’s voice went flat. “Because it’s teaching.”

Lio’s eyes filled. “Teaching what?”

Rowan looked at the pillar, then at the carefully placed supplies, then at the too-clean benches.

"It's teaching me," Rowan said slowly, "that every time I take something, you pay for it."

Like a team-building exercise designed by someone who'd never worked with actual humans. Or office politics where every resource allocation came with strings attached. The System just made it explicit.

Lio stared at her in horror.

Rowan swallowed and felt something inside her go very calm.

This wasn’t a game. It wasn’t a dungeon. It was governance.

Rowan’s gaze hardened.

“Okay,” she said quietly. “Then we don’t take.”

Lio blinked. “But you’re hurt.”

Rowan smiled without humor. “Yes.”

She looked back at the pillar.

Then she did something the system hadn’t prepared her for.

She reached up and scraped her fingernail across the spiral symbol again—hard, defacing, deliberate.

The room flared.

Text flooded her vision.

DEVIATION DETECTED
DEVIATION TYPE: RESOURCE REFUSAL
NOTE: THIS ACTION IS DISCOURAGED

Rowan stared at DISCOURAGED and felt a grim satisfaction.

“Good,” she said. “We’re consistent.”

The pillar’s panel went dark. The glow-veins dimmed. The jug of water cracked down the side with a soft pop, as if the room itself had flinched.

Rowan froze.

Lio gasped. “Rowan—”

Rowan stepped back, heart pounding.

She’d expected a punishment.

She hadn’t expected the environment to react like a system under stress.

She stared at the pillar and thought, with sudden sharp clarity:

It’s not just watching.
It’s integrated.

Rowan looked at Lio.

“Companion zero,” Rowan said under her breath, more to herself than to them.

Lio blinked. “What?”

Rowan shook her head. “Nothing. Just… stay close.”

Because if the system was going to try to isolate her, then Rowan was going to do the opposite.

Rowan sat carefully on the bench—painful, but controlled—and began to tear strips from the cloth bundles without touching the rest. She used them to reinforce both her ankle brace and Lio’s rib wrap.

The cloth was clean. Too clean.

Rowan’s hands were steady anyway.

“I’m not taking your credit,” she said softly to the pillar, as if it could hear her in a way that mattered. “But I will use your waste.”

The system didn’t respond.

But the tug in her attention shifted, and the corridor ahead seemed to brighten, like it wanted them to move on.

Rowan stood.

“Okay,” she said to Lio. “We keep going.”

Lio rose shakily. “Where?”

Rowan looked down the corridor.

The stairs, apparently, did not end.

“Forward,” Rowan said. “And we don’t let it make us alone.”
