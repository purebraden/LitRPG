# Chapter 2
## Path Assignment

Rowan came back in pieces.

First: cold stone against her cheek. Second: the taste of iron. Third: the dull, steady ache of everything that had been injured and had not agreed to heal just because she’d blacked out.

She opened her eyes and the words were still there.

PATH ASSIGNMENT: PENDING

They hovered in the air like a notification she hadn’t dismissed because she didn’t trust what would happen if she did.

Rowan blinked slowly.

“Okay,” she whispered. “So I’m hallucinating… consistently.”

The words did not flicker. They did not wobble with her breathing. They hung in place with the quiet confidence of something that believed it belonged.

Rowan forced herself to sit up. Her left ankle sent a clean spear of pain up her leg, bright enough to make her vision sparkle. She bit down on a groan and instead let out a thin, involuntary laugh.

“Right. Of course.”

Her arm—where the creature had raked her—was wrapped.

Not professionally. Not neatly. But wrapped. A strip of fabric, torn and tied, stained dark with blood. She stared at it, then at her other arm, then at the dead creature a few feet away.

Something had bandaged her while she was unconscious.

Rowan’s throat went dry.

“Hello?” she called, voice echoing in the cavern. “If you’re here, I’d love to negotiate the terms of not being murdered.”

No answer.

The corpse was unchanged. The cavern’s glow-veins pulsed faintly. The air tasted like damp rock and something metallic beneath it, like old coins.

Rowan shifted her weight carefully, fighting nausea. She pressed two fingers to her neck. Pulse: fast, but present.

Then she looked back at the floating text and did the one thing she always did when confronted with a system she didn’t understand.

She tried to interact with it.

Rowan raised a hand and reached toward the words.

Her fingers passed through them without resistance, like they were projected on smoke. She frowned, tried again, slower, and felt—something—a faint pressure, like walking into a cold draft.

“Touchscreen without a screen,” she muttered. “Cute.”

A new line appeared.

USER: RECOGNIZED
IDENTIFIER: ROWAN MERCER
STATUS: ALIVE

Rowan froze.

Her name. Not a guess, not a generic “Hero,” not a placeholder.

That meant it had pulled something from her.

Memory, maybe. Identity. Pattern.

Context injection, her brain supplied automatically. Great.

Another line followed, as if the system had been waiting for her attention.

PATH CANDIDATE AVAILABLE
RECOMMENDED: ACCEPT

Rowan stared at the word RECOMMENDED until it became insulting.

“Recommended by what metric?” she asked the empty air.

The system did not answer.

A moment later, the floating text shifted, reorganizing itself with sterile efficiency.

PATH OFFER: THE STAIR THAT DOES NOT END
OBJECTIVE: REACH THE FIRST DOOR
TIME LIMIT: NONE
FAILURE CONDITION: STAGNATION
REWARD: STABILITY CREDIT (MINOR)
NOTE: PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS IN CURRENT STATE: 12%

Rowan read it twice.

Then a third time, slower.

“Failure condition: stagnation,” she said aloud, because sometimes saying it made the absurdity easier to handle. “That’s… impressively vague.”

She stared at the 12% and felt something like familiar anger rise in her chest. Not fear. Not despair.

Anger.

Because she recognized this.

A dashboard number offered without a model. A percentage thrown at her like it was neutral when it was nothing but persuasion.

Rowan flexed her fingers. Her hands were trembling. Adrenaline hadn’t left; it had simply moved somewhere deeper.

“All right,” she said. “If you’re going to quantify my life, you’re going to do it properly.”

She looked around the cavern again, this time with a new lens: not where am I, but what is the system trying to push me toward?

A door. The first door. Meaning there were more.

Stair. That implied verticality. Either a literal staircase or something metaphorical that wanted to pretend it was.

Rowan swallowed. Her ankle throbbed.

“Stagnation,” she repeated. “So I can fail by… not moving?”

A new line appeared, crisp as a bureaucratic stamp.

FAILURE CONDITION DETAILS:
STAGNATION = NO MEASURABLE PROGRESS TOWARD OBJECTIVE

Rowan stared.

“Measurable,” she said, voice flat. “By you.”

Silence.

She exhaled. Slow. Controlled. She had done this before, in different clothes, with different stakes. The on-call agreement she'd signed three years ago, hidden clauses buried in paragraph twelve that meant they could page her at 3 AM for "critical issues" that turned out to be someone's test environment. The contract with the monitoring vendor that auto-renewed unless you canceled during a two-week window every other year. Same shape. Different room.

A system offered a constraint with hidden subclauses and the choice wasn't really a choice.

She couldn’t stay here. Something had found her once; something could find her again. And if the system punished “no measurable progress,” then simply hiding until she healed might count as failure.

It didn’t say what failure looked like. That omission was its own threat.

Rowan looked at the dead creature again. Its armored plates were cracked where she’d pried them. A groove ran along its underside, softer tissue beneath the shell.

She limped toward it, biting back a gasp, and crouched. Her ankle protested violently.

“Okay,” she whispered. “Loot phase.”

She tore a strip of fabric from the creature’s remains—something like sinewy membrane that dried quickly in the air, leathery and tough. She used it to reinforce the makeshift wrap on her arm, then fashioned a crude brace around her ankle, immobilizing it as best she could.

It was ugly. It would chafe. It would hold.

Rowan tested standing. Pain. But weight-bearing.

“Good enough,” she muttered. “And I’m not dying on principle.”

She looked back up at the floating Path offer.

“I accept,” she said clearly. “With notes.”

For a moment nothing happened.

Rowan waited. Three seconds. Five.

Please hold, your call is important to us, she thought, and almost laughed. The absurdity of treating a life-or-death system prompt like a customer service queue. But here she was, waiting for confirmation like it was a form submission.

Then the words shifted again.

PATH ACCEPTED
PATH STATUS: ACTIVE
DEVIATION TOLERANCE: STANDARD
CORRECTIVE INFLUENCE: DORMANT
NEXT ACTION: PROCEED

Rowan felt it—subtle, like the pressure change before a storm. A tug at the edge of her attention, not a command, not a voice, but a directional weight.

Forward.

Down the darkness.

Rowan stared into the shadowed tunnel at the far end of the cavern—an opening she hadn’t noticed until her eyes adjusted, framed by the same faint glow-veins as everything else.

Of course the exit had been there. Of course the system had waited until she accepted to make it feel inevitable.

Rowan’s jaw tightened.

“Fine,” she said. “But you don’t get to call this consent.”

She limped toward the tunnel, one careful step at a time, and the floating text followed at the edge of her vision like a status bar that refused to be closed.
