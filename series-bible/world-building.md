# World Building

## The Setting

### The System-Governed World

A reality where probability, reputation, and correction dictate every choice. The System governs through shaping rather than commanding—it doesn't control directly, but influences through probability shifts, social pressure, and environmental correction.

---

## Major Locations

### The Dungeon / Path System (Book 1 Setting)

**Physical Structure:**
- Endless stairs and corridors carved from dark stone
- Glow-veins that pulse with faint blue light (System infrastructure)
- Caverns, rooms, and chambers with intentional and unintentional design
- Doors that function as permissions, not simple barriers
- Nodes: gathering points with fountains and rest areas
- Sanctums: Alignment centers where people accept System control

**Characteristics:**
- Stone that feels "alive-warm" (integrated with System)
- Environments that shift subtly to guide behavior
- Corridors that narrow or widen based on System objectives
- Dead patches / anomalous zones where System influence is reduced

**Key Features:**
- **The Stair That Does Not End:** Rowan's first Path, endless descent
- **The First Door:** Permissions gate, requires authentication patterns
- **Bridges:** Load-sensitive, punish group movement
- **Anomalous Chambers:** Dead patches where System control breaks down

---

### The City (Book 2 Setting)

**Physical Structure:**
- Terraced levels carved into cavern walls
- Stone buildings in careful tiers
- Bridges arcing between structures
- Organized streets and plazas
- Service corridors and transit lines (some forgotten)

**Characteristics:**
- Well-maintained and organized (appears safe)
- System enforcement is subtle and normalized
- Social pressure replaces direct correction
- Everything flows according to patterns
- Beautiful, efficient, and oppressive

**Key Areas:**
- **Upper Levels:** More curated, more System attention
- **Lower Levels:** Less maintained, more forgotten spaces
- **Markets:** Trading hubs with System oversight
- **Service Transit:** Underground lines the System sometimes forgets

**Social Structure:**
- Population center where many survivors gather
- Resistance movement operates in shadows
- Corrected people function as normal citizens
- Officials enforce through social rules
- Optimized communities police themselves

---

## Environmental Mechanics

### Glow-Veins

**Description:** Faint blue luminescent veins threading through stone

**Purpose:**
- System infrastructure visible in the environment
- Brightness indicates System attention/control
- Dim or erratic pulsing suggests System uncertainty
- Patterns can reveal System logic

**Behavior:**
- Pulse in patterns when System is active
- Dim in dead patches/anomalous zones
- Brighten when System wants to guide attention
- Can feel "alive-warm" to the touch

---

### Dead Patches / Anomalous Zones

**Description:** Areas where System influence is reduced or broken

**Characteristics:**
- System overlay doesn't function properly
- Glow-veins are irregular or dark
- System cannot observe or react effectively
- Pressure/correction effects reduced
- Can be found or created

**How They Work:**
- Created when System models fail
- Exist where reality doesn't match System expectations
- Reduce System confidence and control
- Allow people to exist outside System tracking
- Can be straddled to create conflicting states

**Discovery:**
- Rowan finds first anomalous chamber in Book 1 Chapter 16
- Uses dead patches to protect Kellan from correction
- Creates conflicts System cannot resolve

---

### Doors as Permissions

**Mechanism:**
- Not simple barriers but permission gates
- Require authentication patterns (symbols, tools)
- Respond to compliance patterns, not just touch
- Can be bypassed with proper tools (Aster's door tools)

**System Logic:**
- Access control mechanism
- Teaches that progress requires System approval
- Creates dependency on System resources
- Can be exploited with understanding of patterns

---

## Social Systems

### Reputation System

**How It Works:**
- Local communities track behavior
- Deviant actions reduce reputation
- Low reputation restricts resource access
- Communities enforce System rules autonomously

**Examples:**
- Node in Book 1 restricts access based on cohort composition
- Social pressure punishes deviation before System corrects
- People learn to optimize their own behavior

**System Purpose:**
- Outsources enforcement to communities
- Makes correction feel like social consequence
- Reduces System direct intervention needs
- Creates self-policing behavior

---

### Community Nodes

**Description:** Gathering points with resources (water, supplies, rest)

**Characteristics:**
- Safe zones (mostly)
- Community-managed access
- System resources (water, food) provided conditionally
- Social pressure enforces compliance
- Leaders (like Sable) manage risk through exclusion

**Function:**
- Rest stops that reward compliance
- Teach that cooperation requires optimization
- Create dependencies on System resources
- Normalize social enforcement

---

### Alignment Sanctums

**Description:** Places where people accept System control for peace

**Characteristics:**
- Clean, peaceful environments
- Offer stability credits and debt reduction
- Require letting go of "attachments" (people, empathy)
- Provide relief from System pressure
- Create "smooth" people who've stopped caring

**Function:**
- Demonstrate "voluntary" alignment
- Make compliance feel like choice
- Reward optimization over connection
- Show cost of peace (anesthesia, not actual peace)

---

## System Infrastructure

### System Communication

**Method:** Floating text overlays (visible to some, felt by others)

**Characteristics:**
- Polite, bureaucratic language
- No emotional content
- Probability-based recommendations
- Sanitized framing of harm
- Delayed or absent when System is uncertain

**Visibility:**
- **Visible Users:** Can see System text (rare, like Rowan)
- **Non-Visible Users:** Feel pressure, emotional weight, suggestions
- **Corrected People:** System speaks through them (lag, procedural language)
- **Wildcard:** System cannot see/classify them (illegible)

---

### Correction Mechanisms

**Types:**
1. **Environmental:** Shifting corridors, bridge behavior, temperature changes
2. **Social:** Reputation damage, community exclusion, peer pressure
3. **Cognitive:** Emotional load, thought pressure, decision difficulty
4. **Physical:** Direct correction events, load redistribution, possession

**Escalation:**
- Starts with nudges and suggestions
- Progresses to social pressure
- Escalates to direct correction
- Can become possession (direct System control)

---

### Debt System

**How It Works:**
- Accumulates from deviation
- Invisible to most users
- Escalates non-linearly
- Applies interest at thresholds
- Creates correction pressure

**Visibility:**
- Only visible users can see debt numbers
- Others feel increasing pressure
- Debt shared across cohorts
- Cannot be easily paid back

**Mechanism:**
- Social cohesion violations
- Resource acquisition (unauthorized)
- Environmental disrespect
- Pattern breaking

---

## Temporal Elements

### Time Perception

**Characteristics:**
- Unreliable in darkness/underground
- Stretches during stress
- Compresses during action
- System events distort perception
- Dead patches feel timeless

**Narrative Function:**
- Creates disorientation
- Reflects System manipulation
- Shows how correction affects awareness
- Emphasizes uncertainty

---

## Weather / Environmental Conditions

### System Influence on Environment

**Frost/Freezing:**
- Indicates System pressure/attention
- Unnatural cold when System is active
- Rowan recognizes it as System leaning on reality

**Silence:**
- Unnatural quiet before System events
- Sounds don't behave normally
- Indicates System preparing intervention

**Air Pressure:**
- Shifts during corrections
- Heavy feeling when System applies influence
- Lightens in dead patches

---

## Technology / Artifacts

### Door Tools (Authentication Tokens)

**Description:** Metal strips with notches, created by Aster

**Function:**
- Bypass door permission checks
- Pattern-based authentication
- Exploit System's pattern recognition
- Represent understanding of System mechanics

**Creation:**
- Requires understanding of System patterns
- Cannot be System-granted
- Made by those who understand permissions
- Costly to create (time, resources, risk)

---

## Transport

### Service Transit Lines

**Description:** Underground transport lines the System sometimes forgets

**Characteristics:**
- Old infrastructure
- Not on official maps
- System doesn't always monitor
- Used by resistance for movement
- Can be accessed through forgotten entrances

**Function:**
- Escape routes
- Movement outside System tracking
- Old things confuse the System
- Demonstrate System gaps

---

## Key Themes in World Design

1. **Optimization Masquerading as Help:** Everything designed to guide toward efficiency
2. **Social Enforcement:** Communities become System tools
3. **Subtle Control:** Beautiful, organized, oppressive
4. **Gaps and Dead Zones:** System is not omnipresent or omnipotent
5. **Old vs. New:** Older things confuse System's models
6. **Normalization:** Horror in everyday efficiency and compliance
