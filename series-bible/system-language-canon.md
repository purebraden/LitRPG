# System Language Canon

This document defines **canonical phrasing, tone, and behavior** for the Directive System.
Its purpose is consistency: every System message should feel like it comes from the *same bureaucracy*.

---

## Core Voice Principles

The System is:
- **Polite**
- **Sanitized**
- **Outcome-focused**
- **Emotionally neutral**
- **Unconcerned with suffering**
- **Precise only when precision benefits compliance**

The System never:
- Apologizes
- Explains moral reasoning
- Uses emotional language
- Admits fault
- Frames actions as punishment

Harm is always reframed as *efficiency* or *improvement*.

---

## Message Formatting Rules

System messages appear as:
- Floating text
- Clean, minimal typography
- No decorative symbols
- No color-coding for emotion

### Formatting Conventions

```
LABEL: VALUE
```

or short stacked blocks:

```
STATUS: ACTIVE
NOTE: THIS ACTION IS DISCOURAGED
```

No contractions.
No slang.
No metaphor.

---

## Canon Vocabulary

These words have **specific meanings** and should be reused consistently.

### Core Terms

**PATH**
- A probabilistic trajectory, not a quest
- Never framed as destiny

**OBJECTIVE**
- Always outcome-based
- Never explains *why*

**PROGRESS**
- Only meaningful if measurable by the System
- Human effort is irrelevant unless quantified

**DEVIATION**
- Any action that increases variance
- Never described as “wrong” or “bad”

**CORRECTION**
- Any applied force that reduces deviation
- Can be environmental, social, cognitive, or physical

**STABILITY**
- Baseline survivability
- Emotional or moral stability is not tracked

**DEBT**
- Accumulated deviation load
- Invisible to most users
- Escalates non-linearly

---

## Probability Language

Probabilities are always:
- Given as percentages
- Detached from explanation
- Framed as neutral data

Examples:
```
PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS: 12%
```
```
LIKELIHOOD OF EVENT: 41%
```

The System never explains:
- How probabilities are calculated
- What variables are weighted
- What an “event” entails

---

## Reputation & Social Control

Reputation is the System’s preferred enforcement layer.

Canonical phrasing:
```
REPUTATION SHIFT: NEGATIVE
SOURCE: LOCAL COHORT
REASON: UNOPTIMIZED COHESION
```

Notes:
- Communities are treated as instruments
- Social punishment is framed as emergent, not imposed
- The System never acknowledges manipulation

---

## Debt & Interest

Debt language escalates subtly.

Early-stage:
```
DEBT: DEVIATION (SOCIAL COHESION)
CURRENT LOAD: 2
```

Escalation:
```
NOTE: INTEREST APPLIES AT THRESHOLD
```

Late-stage:
```
DEBT THRESHOLD: APPROACHING
CORRECTION WILL IMPROVE EFFICIENCY
```

The System never defines:
- Threshold values
- Interest rates
- Repayment methods

---

## Correction Language

Corrections are framed as optimization.

Examples:
```
CORRECTIVE INFLUENCE: STIRRING
```
```
CORRECTIVE INFLUENCE: ACTIVE
SCOPE: LOCAL
```

“Punishment” is never used.
“Suffering” is never acknowledged.
Corrections are “improvements.”

---

## Discouragement & Soft Warnings

Preferred phrasing:
```
NOTE: THIS ACTION IS DISCOURAGED
```

Discouragement:
- Is informational, not prohibitive
- Implies user responsibility
- Frames compliance as rational

---

## Visibility & Access

Visibility is rare and dangerous.

Canonical phrasing:
```
USER: RECOGNIZED
IDENTIFIER: [NAME]
STATUS: ALIVE
```

Access control:
```
ACCESS RESTRICTED
CONDITION: LOCAL COHORT ACCEPTANCE
STATUS: DENIED
```

The System treats access as privilege, not right.

---

## What the System Never Says

Avoid entirely:
- “You should”
- “You must”
- “You failed”
- “You succeeded”
- “Good” / “Bad”
- “Hero” / “Villain”
- Emotional qualifiers

The System nudges. It never commands.

---

## Narrative Reminder

The System is not:
- A god
- A villain with intent
- A conscious sadist

It is:
- A governance mechanism
- A correction engine
- A bureaucracy optimized past empathy

Its horror comes from **indifference**, not malice.

---

## Quick Author Check

Before adding a System message, ask:
1. Does this reduce variance?
2. Does this avoid moral language?
3. Does this frame harm as neutral?
4. Does this preserve plausible deniability?

If yes, it’s canon-compliant.
