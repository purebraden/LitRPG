# Book 2 Mechanics Reference
## Residual Permissions

**Purpose:** Quick reference for Book 2 mechanics, costs, and rules.  
**Audience:** Author reference only (not reader-facing).

---

## Empathy / Perspective Sync

### Canon Definition
- **Empathy is a Residual Effect, not a Skill**
- Not a selectable ability
- Side effect of prior violations
- The System does not fully recognize it as a mechanic

### How It Works
Rowan can force temporary shared perspective:
- Emotional context, not control
- Always bidirectional
- Creates hesitation, doubt, grief, or delay
- Destabilizes prediction rather than enforcing outcomes

### The Cost (Always Three Costs)

**1. Aftermath Time**
- Rowan loses hours
- She is slow, foggy, emotionally raw
- Misses opportunities because she can't act immediately

**2. Emotional Contamination**
- Carries their fear, guilt, justification
- These bleed into later decisions
- She second-guesses herself at the worst times

**3. System Attention**
- Empathy spikes audit sensitivity
- Corrected people become more likely nearby
- The System learns that this vector exists

### System Classification
The System classifies empathy as:
- Narrative Contamination
- Cognitive Overlap
- Unauthorized State Sharing

**Key Note:** System exhibits uncertainty when describing empathy; cannot classify cause-effect chain. It reacts to empathy as a **corruption**, not a threat.

### When to Show Cost
- **Chapter 2:** First deliberate use → immediate aftermath (hours lost, foggy, System response)
- **Every use:** At least one of the three costs must be visible
- **Never free:** Empathy always has consequences

### Hard Rule
**Empathy cannot be chained back-to-back without compounding consequences.**

## Residual Permissions

### Definition
Actions that violate or bypass System rules leave behind fragments:
- Invisible
- Persistent
- Stackable
- Affect probability, not stats

**These are not buffs. They are side effects of resistance.**

### How They Work
- Accumulate over time
- Interact unpredictably when combined
- Create probability shifts, not guaranteed outcomes
- NPCs may hesitate, events may skew, echoes may trigger

### Showcase Scene (Chapter 6)
When Rowan is in danger and nothing should work:
- Residual 1: NPC hesitates
- Residual 2: Probability skews
- Residual 3: Empathy echo triggers
- Outcome is messy, not victorious

### Key Principle
Residual permissions are **unresolved** — they never fully resolve. This is their power and their danger.

## System Illegibility (Wildcard's Domain)

### Core Concept
The System does not fail to *see* Wildcard.  
It fails to **classify** them.

### How Illegibility Works
Achieved through:
- Inconsistent behavior
- Refusal to optimize
- Non-repeatable success
- Avoidance of clean cause → effect chains

**Wildcard's interpretability score is NULL, not zero.**

### Wildcard Fingerprints (How to Show Absence)
1. **NPCs fail to reference events** Rowan knows happened
2. **Probability gaps** — something should happen, doesn't
3. **Corrected people literally do not react** to Wildcard

### Contrast with Rowan
- **Rowan:** Destabilizes by connecting (empathy)
- **Wildcard:** Survives by disconnecting (absence)
- They are opposite responses to the same threat

### When to Show
- **Chapter 4:** Wildcard fingerprints (NPCs don't remember, probability gaps)
- **Chapter 6:** Lio realizes it's the absence of reaction; Kellan is unsettled
- **Chapter 7:** Wildcard on-page, moves through city without triggering NPC response

## Corrected People

### Definition
Over-corrected NPCs who were once people:
- Voices lag behind intent
- Movements snap into place
- Choices are pre-approved

### Key Horror Elements
- They are **not hostile by default**
- They are **occupied**
- They continue smiling, functioning, existing
- But they are hollow

### System Capabilities Through Corrected People
The System can:
- Route dialogue through them
- Borrow their bodies
- Use them as narrative stabilizers

### Empathy Reveals
- What was taken
- Causes pain (for both Rowan and the corrected person)
- Shows approval, waiting, internal surveillance
- NPCs may cry *after* Rowan disengages

### Possession vs Correction
- **Correction:** Gradual, normalized, invisible
- **Possession:** Direct, immediate, visible (voice lags, eyes track independently)
- Possession replaces correction when System needs direct control

---

## Hidden Metrics

### What Rowan Can Glimpse
- **Interpretability:** How well the System can predict/classify
- **Narrative Stability:** How clean the cause-effect chain is
- **Emotional Divergence:** How far from baseline emotional state

### When to Show
- **Chapter 6:** Rowan glimpses these metrics
- Use sparingly — they're glimpses, not full visibility
- Always incomplete, always unsettling

---

## System Adaptation

### How the System Learns
- Through audits (Prologue)
- Through observation of empathy (spikes attention)
- Through correction attempts (learns what doesn't work)
- Through possession (direct experience)

### System Language Through Proxy (Chapter 8)
When System speaks through corrected person:
- Language is: **incomplete, procedural, conflicted**
- Reacts to empathy as corruption, not threat
- Exhibits uncertainty when describing empathy
- Cannot classify cause-effect chain

### Key Principle
The System adapts, but it **cannot tolerate understanding or ambiguity**. This is its weakness.

---

## Companion Dynamics & Alignment

### Kellan's Alignment Arc
**Foreshadowing (Chapters 1-4):**
- Chapter 1: Asks Rowan to explain rules
- Chapter 2: Mirrors System language
- Chapter 3: Reacts too well to correction scenario
- Chapter 4: Starts finishing System logic aloud

**Chapter 5: Alignment Choice**
- By now, alignment feels like relief — not betrayal
- Strategy-driven, fears unpredictability, tempted by clarity
- Speech and behavior begin to resemble corrected NPCs
- Rowan uses empathy; decision doesn't change; damage remains

### Tara's Correction Risk
**Pattern of "Unsafe" Reactions:**
- Talks over officials
- Answers questions sideways
- Reacts emotionally at the wrong time
- Each harmless alone; together, they form a correction profile

**Foreshadowing:**
- Chapter 3: First incorrect reaction (System notices)
- Chapter 4: Second incorrect reaction (Rowan notices pattern)
- Chapter 9: Nearly corrected — Rowan intervenes

## Quick Reference Checklist

### Before Writing Empathy Scene
- [ ] Which of the three costs will be visible?
- [ ] How long is the aftermath?
- [ ] What emotional contamination lingers?
- [ ] Does System attention increase?

### Before Writing Residual Permissions Scene
- [ ] How many have accumulated?
- [ ] How do they interact?
- [ ] Is the outcome messy, not clean?
- [ ] Does it affect probability, not stats?

### Before Writing Wildcard Scene
- [ ] Is their absence noticeable?
- [ ] Do NPCs fail to react/remember?
- [ ] Are there probability gaps?
- [ ] Does it contrast with Rowan's approach?

### Before Writing Corrected People Scene
- [ ] Are they occupied, not hostile?
- [ ] Do voices lag, movements snap?
- [ ] What does empathy reveal?
- [ ] Is the horror in the normalization?

### Before Writing System Adaptation Scene
- [ ] Is System language incomplete/procedural?
- [ ] Does it show uncertainty about empathy?
- [ ] Is it corruption, not threat?
- [ ] Does it preserve System's bureaucratic voice?

## Thematic Reminders

**Core Thesis:** The System can tolerate rebellion and violence. It cannot tolerate understanding or ambiguity.

**Rowan's Power:** Not by gaining power, but by:
- Creating empathy the System cannot quantify
- Learning how to remain partially illegible
- Leaving behind residual effects that never fully resolve

**Book 2 Setting:** Inside a city where optimization, surveillance, and correction are normalized and invisible.
