# The Directive System

The System governs reality through probability shaping rather than commands.

## Characteristics
- Polite
- Bureaucratic
- Ominously neutral
- Emotionally indifferent
- Outcome-focused, not intention-focused

## Core Rules
- Assigns Paths, not quests
- Rewards outcomes, not intentions
- Punishes deviation socially before lethally
- Frames harm as efficiency or improvement
- Never apologizes or admits fault

**Principle:** Power gained through the System increases System influence. Power gained through choice destabilizes it.

## System Adaptation

### How the System Learns
- Through audits (observing behavior patterns)
- Through observation of empathy use (spikes attention)
- Through correction attempts (learns what doesn't work)
- Through possession (direct experience through corrected people)
- Through probability shifts and outcome tracking

### Adaptation Mechanisms
- **Model Updates:** System adjusts predictions based on observed behavior
- **Tactic Shifts:** Changes approach when current methods fail
- **Confidence Reduction:** System becomes uncertain, changes strategy
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifies and responds to new resistance patterns
- **Isolation:** Sandboxes anomalies to reduce their impact

### System Response to Anomalies
When System encounters persistent anomalies (like Rowan):
1. **Initial Response:** Correction attempts, escalation
2. **Adaptation:** Changes tactics, isolates anomaly
3. **Sandboxing:** Restricts visibility and access
4. **Model Review:** Recalculates predictions and strategies
5. **Limited Interaction:** Reduces direct communication

**Key Weakness:** System cannot tolerate understanding or ambiguity. Uncertainty reduces its effectiveness.

## Isolation & Sandboxing

### How It Works
When System identifies persistent anomaly:
- **Visibility Restriction:** Reduces what anomaly can see/access
- **Access Control:** Limits interaction with System resources
- **Private Channels:** Creates isolated communication (visible only to anomaly)
- **Subject-Specific Parameters:** Custom rules applied to specific individuals

### Purpose
- Reduces anomaly's ability to learn/exploit System
- Prevents information spread to others
- Allows System to study without interference
- Maintains control while adapting strategies

### Rowan's Experience
- System isolated her after pattern-breaking (Book 1 Chapter 18)
- Private updates visible only to her
- System watches more closely but communicates less
- Reduced visibility creates uncertainty

## Correction vs. Possession

### Correction
**Nature:** Gradual, normalized, invisible

**Characteristics:**
- People maintain some autonomy
- Behavior optimized over time
- Feels like natural choice/improvement
- Social pressure reinforces behavior
- Can be resisted (with effort/cost)

**Examples:**
- Alignment at sanctums (voluntary acceptance)
- Social enforcement (community pressure)
- Reputation systems (self-policing)
- Kellan's alignment arc (gradual shift)

### Possession
**Nature:** Direct, immediate, visible

**Characteristics:**
- System directly controls person
- Voice lags behind intent
- Eyes track independently
- Movements snap into place
- Direct System communication through person
- No autonomy remaining

**Examples:**
- System speaking through corrected NPCs
- Direct control during corrections
- Emergency override situations

### Key Difference
- **Correction:** System shapes behavior through incentives and pressure
- **Possession:** System directly controls, bypassing person's agency
- Possession is escalation from correction
- Possession used when correction fails or System needs direct control

## System Limitations

### What the System Cannot Do
- **Cannot tolerate ambiguity or uncertainty:** Loses effectiveness when models fail
- **Cannot predict illegible entities:** Wildcard exists outside classification
- **Cannot optimize empathy:** Cannot quantify or control emotional connection
- **Cannot handle conflicting requirements:** Stalls when forced to choose between bad options
- **Cannot adapt faster than persistent resistance:** Learning has limits

### System Blind Spots
- **Dead patches/anomalous zones:** Reduced influence areas
- **Old infrastructure:** Forgotten systems confuse models
- **Non-repeatable patterns:** System requires consistency to predict
- **Emotional contamination:** Cannot fully model human connection
- **Residual permissions:** Unresolved effects it cannot track

### System Weaknesses
1. **Depends on predictable behavior** - Fails when people refuse patterns
2. **Requires classification** - Cannot handle NULL interpretability
3. **Needs efficiency metrics** - Struggles with messy, unresolved states
4. **Social enforcement requires cooperation** - Can be disrupted
5. **Adaptation takes time** - Cannot instantly respond to new patterns

## System Communication Methods

### Through Overlay (Visible Users)
- Floating text notifications
- Probability percentages
- Status updates
- Recommendations (disguised as suggestions)

### Through Pressure (Non-Visible Users)
- Emotional weight
- Physical discomfort
- Cognitive friction
- Directional nudges

### Through Corrected People
- System speaks directly through them
- Voice lags, movements snap
- Procedural language
- Incomplete/inconsistent communication

### Through Environment
- Frost, silence, pressure changes
- Corridor shifts, bridge behavior
- Resource availability
- Social cues and reputation
