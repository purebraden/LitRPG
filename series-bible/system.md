# The Directive System

The System governs reality through probability shaping rather than commands.

## Characteristics
- Polite
- Bureaucratic
- Ominously neutral

## Core Rules
- Assigns Paths, not quests
- Rewards outcomes, not intentions
- Punishes deviation socially before lethally

Power gained through the System increases System influence.
Power gained through choice destabilizes it.
