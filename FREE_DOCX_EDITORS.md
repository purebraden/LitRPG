## Option 4: Fix Issues Before Conversion

If you prefer to fix issues in the source markdown files instead of editing DOCX:

1. Fix encoding in markdown files (ensure UTF-8)
2. Improve the conversion script to handle encoding better
3. Convert again with better settings

See `FIX_ENCODING_ISSUES.md` for details.

## Recommended Approach

**For your situation, I recommend:**

1. **Use Google Docs** (easiest, no installation)
   - Upload the DOCX
   - Fix System messages and encoding
   - Download as DOCX
   - Upload to KDP

2. **OR use LibreOffice** (if you prefer offline/desktop software)
   - Install once, use forever
   - Better for future editing

Both are free and will work for KDP publishing.
