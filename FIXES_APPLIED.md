## Partially Fixed Chapters

### Chapters 6-20
- Fixed all "Which meant—" / "That meant—" patterns
- Need: Dark humor additions, content expansion, sentence variety improvements

## Remaining Work

### High Priority (All Chapters 6-20)
1. Add 2-3 dark humor moments per chapter
2. Expand key scenes by 30-50%
3. Vary sentence starts (reduce "Rowan [verb]" clusters)
4. Add micro-thoughts (1 per chapter minimum)
5. Add sensory details beyond visual
6. Expand dialogue and character interactions

### Medium Priority
- Reduce motif word repetition (optimize, deviation, correction, debt)
- Add more physical details (pain, fatigue, movement)
- Improve dialogue rhythm (interruptions, silence, overlap)

## Word Count Progress
- Starting: ~22,000 words
- Current: ~25,000+ words (estimated)
- Target: 60,000-80,000 words
- Still need: ~35,000-55,000 more words

## Next Steps
Continue applying fixes to chapters 6-20 systematically, focusing on:
1. Dark humor (every 2-3 pages)
2. Content expansion (30-50% per chapter)
3. Sentence variety
4. Micro-thoughts and sensory details
