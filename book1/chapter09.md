# Chapter 9
## The Event

The corridor didn’t announce the correction.

No siren. No text in bold. Just a gentle change in the air—as if the stone decided to breathe a little shallower.

The glow-veins ahead brightened, and behind them the light dimmed to an ugly, bruise-purple. The hallway that had felt like a runway now felt like a funnel.

Rowan stopped walking.

Kellan nearly collided with her back. “What—”

“Quiet,” she said, not harsh, just certain.

Lio hovered on her left, clutching the waterskin like it was contraband. Their eyes were wide and too shiny.

A faint sound rolled toward them from behind. Footsteps. Many. Then voices—murmured, tense, rising and falling like people arguing without wanting the argument to exist.

Rowan’s mind tried to map it the way she’d mapped outages. Identify the source. Trace the propagation. Find the lever being pulled.

The system had said “event.”

This was the event: a social ripple. A crowd.

Kellan swore under his breath. “They followed.”

“Of course they did,” Rowan murmured. “It’s cheaper than sending monsters.”

Lio looked like they might vomit. “Rowan, what do we do?”

Rowan didn’t answer immediately. She was watching the corridor behind them, watching the darkness flicker with approaching light.

The crowd rounded the curve.

Sable was in front.

Her pace was controlled, purposeful. The people behind her were not. Some looked angry. Some looked scared. Most looked resigned—like they were walking because walking was the only way to stop the feeling.

Rowan saw it on their faces and felt something cold in her stomach.

That heaviness. That whispering “give up.” The system didn’t need a voice in Rowan’s head if it could outsource enforcement to people who couldn’t tolerate the pressure any other way.

Sable stopped ten feet away.

She didn’t raise her voice. She didn’t have to.

“Kellan,” she said. “You brought them to the stores.”

Kellan lifted his chin. “Yes.”

Murmurs behind Sable. A sharp inhale. Someone muttered, “Idiot.”

Sable’s eyes flicked to Rowan, then Lio. “You took supplies.”

Rowan didn’t deny it. “Water and bandages.”

Sable’s mouth tightened. “You know what that does.”

“No,” Rowan said calmly. “I know what you think it does.”

Sable’s gaze hardened. “You’re not the first person to think they can outsmart it.”

Rowan almost laughed. Almost. She’d heard the same tone in conference rooms with bad leaders: the patronizing certainty that systems were natural laws and not human decisions.

“I’m not trying to outsmart it,” Rowan said. “I’m trying to survive without turning into… whatever you are.”

The words came out sharper than she intended.

Sable flinched, very slightly. The crowd shifted. A few faces hardened.

Kellan stepped forward, putting himself half a step ahead of Rowan like he could shield her from a mob with his ribs.

“It’s my choice,” he said. “Not theirs.”

Sable’s eyes narrowed. “No. It doesn’t work like that.”

Rowan’s overlay flickered at the edge of her vision, and she hated herself for looking, but she needed the information.

CORRECTIVE INFLUENCE: ACTIVE
SCOPE: COHORT
MECHANISM: REINTEGRATION
SUGGESTED REMEDIATION: RETURN RESOURCES / RETURN DEVIATORS

Rowan’s jaw clenched.

Reintegration. Like they were malware.

Lio’s hand tightened on Rowan’s sleeve.

A memory flashed—Rowan at her old desk, fluorescent lights buzzing, watching a Slack thread explode during an outage while someone in leadership typed, “Can we get the team aligned?” as if “alignment” would stop a database from falling over.

The same energy. The same dangerous comfort in “getting back to normal.”

Rowan forced her voice softer. Less sharp. “Sable. Why are you doing this?”

Sable’s gaze flicked over the crowd behind her. Then back to Rowan, and there—just for a moment—Rowan saw exhaustion.

“Because I can’t afford another correction,” Sable said quietly. “Because the last time someone stole supplies, the water stopped running for three days. People got sick.”

Rowan’s chest tightened. “You’re blaming the thief. Not the system.”

Sable’s face went rigid. “Blame doesn’t matter. Survival does.”

A man in the crowd spoke up, voice trembling with fear-dressed-as-anger. “Give them back. Just give them back and go. We don’t want trouble.”

Lio made a small sound, a whimper they tried to swallow.

Rowan felt the system’s pressure then—not a tug toward movement, but a subtle suggestion, like the easy path being placed in her hand.

Give the water back. Offer Kellan. Keep Lio. Trade one for the many.

Rowan could feel how tempting it was for them. Not because they were cruel, but because the weight in their minds would ease if they complied. The system had turned relief into a reward.

Rowan’s throat went dry.

She remembered being twenty-two, first job in tech, first week on-call. Her phone had screamed at 2:17 a.m., and she’d sat up in bed so fast she’d smacked her knee on the nightstand. She’d spent the next six hours fixing a cascading failure someone else had set up months ago, and when the sun came up she’d felt like she’d aged ten years.

She’d gone into the office later that morning, hair still damp from a too-fast shower, and her manager had said, smiling, “Great job, Rowan. Next time, try not to escalate so quickly.”

She’d nodded. She’d swallowed her anger. She’d learned the lesson: make the system comfortable, even if it hurts you.

She’d regretted it for years.

Not again.

Rowan lifted the waterskin from Lio’s hands. Lio startled.

Rowan held it up so the crowd could see.

Silence tightened.

Rowan’s overlay flickered.

LIKELIHOOD OF EVENT: 78%

Rowan ignored it.

“This?” she said, voice clear. “This is water.”

Someone in the crowd flinched as if she’d raised a weapon.

Rowan gestured toward the node behind them, the direction the fountain was in. “You have water back there. You’re letting the system decide who’s allowed to drink.”

Sable’s eyes sharpened. “Don’t—”

Rowan cut her off gently. “No. Listen.”

She turned her gaze to the crowd. Faces. People. A teenager with a split lip. A woman clutching a child’s hand so tightly the child’s fingers were white. A man with a hollow stare like he hadn’t slept in weeks.

“I get it,” Rowan said. “I get why you’re doing this. Relief feels like safety.”

The crowd shifted, murmuring.

“And the system is counting on that,” Rowan continued. “It’s training you to do its corrections for it. Because it’s cheaper.”

Sable’s voice snapped, suddenly loud. “Stop!”

Rowan froze.

Not because Sable was loud, but because the air changed.

A pressure wave swept the corridor. Not a blast—more like gravity briefly increasing, making everyone’s shoulders dip.

People gasped. Some staggered.

Lio cried out, hands flying to their head.

Kellan bent at the waist, teeth clenched. “There—it is—”

Rowan felt it too, but differently. Her thoughts didn’t get heavier. Instead, the edges of her vision sharpened. Like the system had decided she needed to see exactly what it was doing.

Text appeared, crisp and merciless.

CORRECTION EVENT: COHORT REALIGNMENT
EFFECT: EMOTIONAL LOAD INCREASE (NON-VISIBLE USERS)
DURATION: UNTIL REMEDIATION

Rowan stared.

“You’re doing it,” she whispered.

Sable’s face twisted with pain. “Don’t make this worse.”

Rowan looked at her.

This wasn’t a villain. This was a person being used.

Rowan exhaled slowly, then stepped forward, limping, until she was closer to Sable than was wise.

She held the waterskin out.

A collective inhale from the crowd.

Sable’s eyes flicked to it, hungry and fearful at once.

Rowan’s overlay flashed:

SUGGESTED REMEDIATION: SURRENDER RESOURCES / SURRENDER DEVIATOR (KELLAN)

Rowan’s grip tightened.

She held the waterskin steady. “You can take this,” Rowan said quietly. “And you can still be wrong.”

Sable’s hand twitched toward it.

Then Rowan pulled the waterskin back, just a fraction.

“But you don’t get him,” Rowan said, voice low. “And you don’t get her.” She nodded toward Lio, trembling behind her.

Sable’s eyes widened. “We can’t—”

“You can,” Rowan said. “You’re choosing not to because you want the weight to stop.”

The crowd murmured. Someone sobbed softly.

Rowan raised her voice just enough to carry. “Here’s what I’ll do. I’ll return the water. I’ll return the extra bandages. But Kellan stays with us.”

Kellan jerked his head up. “Rowan—”

Rowan glanced back at him. “This isn’t charity. This is negotiation.”

She turned back to Sable. “If the system punishes you anyway, you’ll know it wasn’t about the supplies.”

Sable stared at Rowan like she’d never been offered a third option in her life.

The pressure in the air eased slightly—as if the system approved of partial compliance.

Rowan felt sick.

Sable’s jaw worked. “Fine,” she said finally.

Rowan handed the waterskin over.

The moment Sable’s fingers closed around it, the pressure wave eased. People straightened. Several exhaled like they’d been drowning.

Rowan watched their relief and hated the system more.

Sable’s voice went brittle. “Give the rest.”

Rowan nodded once and gestured to Kellan. He pulled out half the bandages and tossed them forward.

Sable caught them clumsily.

The overlay updated.

CORRECTION EVENT: RESOLVING
NOTE: EFFICIENCY IMPROVED

Rowan’s mouth went tight.

She glanced at Lio. Their face had color again. Their eyes focused.

“You okay?” Rowan asked softly.

Lio nodded, shakily. “It got quieter.”

Rowan looked back at Sable. “You feel better now?”

Sable’s jaw clenched. “Yes.”

Rowan leaned in and spoke so only Sable could hear. “That feeling? That relief? It’s a leash.”

Sable’s eyes flickered with something like fear. “And what are you going to do?”

Rowan didn’t smile. “Chew through it.”

Rowan stepped back, then turned to the corridor ahead.

“Come on,” she said to Kellan and Lio. “We move before it recalculates.”

Kellan followed, shoulders tense. Lio stayed close.

Behind them, Sable’s voice rang out, sharp. “If you bring correction back here again—”

Rowan didn’t turn around.

“Then you’ll have to decide whether you’re protecting people,” she called over her shoulder, “or protecting the system.”

They walked.

And in Rowan’s vision, the debt ledger ticked upward anyway, quiet as a clock.

DEBT: CURRENT LOAD 7
NOTE: INTEREST PENDING

Rowan swallowed hard.

So. Payment deferred.

That meant the system would collect later.
