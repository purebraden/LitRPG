# Chapter 11
## The Team

They didn’t talk much after leaving Aster.

The corridor narrowed again. The air grew damp. The glow-veins pulsed slowly, like they were tired too.

Rowan’s pain blurred at the edges into a constant roar. She could feel where her ankle brace rubbed raw skin. Her arm throbbed beneath the crude wrap. Every breath reminded her that ribs didn’t like being introduced to stone at high speed.

Still, she kept moving.

Because stopping was stagnation.
Because stagnation was failure.
Because failure was undefined.

She hated undefined failure conditions. They were always worse than the documented ones.

Lio broke the silence first. “Do you think we did the right thing back there?”

Rowan didn’t answer immediately.

A memory rose up uninvited: a friend from her old team—Maya—standing in the break room after a bad incident, staring into a cup of coffee like it contained the meaning of the universe. “If we’d just rolled back sooner,” Maya had said, voice thin. “If we’d just—”

Rowan had put a hand on her shoulder and said, “We made the best call with the information we had.”

Maya had shaken her head. “That’s what people say when they don’t want to be blamed.”

Rowan had never forgotten that.

Rowan looked at Lio now, at their anxious eyes.

“We did what we chose,” Rowan said carefully. “The system wants you to confuse choice with outcome.”

Lio frowned. “But what if the outcome is bad?”

Rowan’s mouth tightened. “Then we deal with it. Together.”

Kellan’s voice was rough. “Together gets you killed.”

Rowan looked at him. “No. Together gets you hurt. Alone gets you compliant.”

Kellan swallowed hard. His gaze flicked away.

Rowan understood, then, that Kellan wasn’t arguing with her.

He was arguing with his own past.

They reached a junction where the corridor split into three paths. No signage. No helpful overlay arrow. Just stone and choice.

Rowan’s overlay appeared anyway, subtle as a suggestion in her peripheral vision.

SUGGESTED ROUTE: RIGHT
PROBABILITY OF SURVIVAL: 61%
NOTE: COHORT SIZE IMPACTS EFFICIENCY

Rowan stared at the note.

Cohort size impacts efficiency.

She could almost hear the system saying it, politely: Smaller teams are easier to manage. Fewer variables. Less noise.

Rowan swallowed.

A thought landed, simple and sharp: If I keep choosing people, I will keep paying.

She turned to Kellan and Lio.

“Stop here,” Rowan said. “We need to decide something.”

Lio’s eyes went wide. “About which path?”

Rowan shook her head. “About us.”

Kellan’s shoulders tightened. “Rowan—”

Rowan held up a hand. “No. Listen.”

Rowan’s voice stayed steady, but inside her chest her heart pounded. She hated speeches. She hated leadership-by-declaration. She’d seen too many people use words to cover up harm.

So she kept it small. Honest.

“I can feel it,” Rowan said. “How the system wants this to go. It wants me alone. It wants you both… as optional.”

Lio’s face went pale. “Are you saying—”

Rowan shook her head quickly. “No. I’m saying the opposite.”

Kellan’s eyes narrowed. “What’s the opposite of optional?”

Rowan breathed out, tasting dust. “Deliberate.”

She looked at Lio first. “Lio, staying with me will make your life harder.”

Lio’s jaw trembled. “It’s already hard.”

Rowan nodded. “Yes. But it’ll get harder. The system will press you. It will use you to punish me, and use me to punish you. You didn’t ask for that.”

Lio’s eyes filled with tears. “I didn’t ask for any of this.”

Rowan’s throat tightened. “I know.”

She turned to Kellan. “And you. The node will treat you like a contaminant now. You saw it. You felt it. You can still go back.”

Kellan’s mouth twisted. “Go back to being useful.”

Rowan didn’t correct him. It was his word. His wound.

Rowan looked at both of them. “So. This is the moment. If either of you wants to walk away—walk away now. No blame. No speeches. No guilt.”

Silence.

For a second, the only sound was the faint pulse of glowing veins and the distant drip of water.

Lio wiped their face with the back of their hand. “If I walk away,” they whispered, “will it stop?”

Rowan didn’t lie. “Maybe.”

Lio stared at the ground. “Then why wouldn’t I?”

Rowan thought of Earth again—of the quiet temptations to stop caring, to stop fighting, to stop being the person who stayed late and fixed things no one thanked her for. She’d taken the easier path sometimes. She wasn’t proud of it. She also wasn’t ashamed. She was human.

Rowan said quietly, “Because you’ll still be you.”

Lio looked up. “And if I stay?”

Rowan met their eyes. “Then you’ll still be you. But you’ll be you with allies.”

Kellan exhaled a bitter laugh. “Allies. In a dungeon.”

Rowan glanced at him. “You helped us. You didn’t have to.”

Kellan’s face tightened. “I did it for me.”

Rowan nodded. “That counts too.”

Kellan stared at the corridor split, jaw clenched so hard it looked painful.

Then he said, hoarse, “I’m not going back.”

Rowan held his gaze. “Are you sure?”

Kellan swallowed. “No.”

Rowan almost smiled. “Good. Certainty is how the system gets you.”

Lio let out a shaky laugh, then nodded hard. “I’m staying.”

Rowan’s chest loosened in a way she hadn’t realized was tight.

She didn’t say thank you. She didn’t call them brave. She didn’t romanticize it.

She just nodded once.

“Okay,” Rowan said. “Then we’re a team.”

Her overlay flickered.

DEVIATION: CONFIRMED (COHORT COMMITMENT)
DEVIATION TOLERANCE: REDUCED
NOTE: CORRECTIVE INFLUENCE ESCALATION LIKELY

Rowan’s mouth went dry.

Kellan looked at her face. “That’s bad, isn’t it.”

Rowan nodded once. “Yes.”

Lio swallowed. “Then why do I feel… better?”

Rowan’s gaze softened slightly. “Because it’s ours.”

She turned toward the left corridor.

Not the suggested route. Not the 61% survival line.

The one that felt… less curated. Less like it wanted them.

Kellan frowned. “Why left?”

Rowan’s voice was quiet. “Because if the system is steering, I want to know what it doesn’t want me to see.”

Kellan exhaled. “Of course you do.”

Rowan started walking.

Behind her, Lio and Kellan followed.

And for the first time since the fall, the heaviness in Rowan’s chest wasn’t just fear.

It was purpose.
