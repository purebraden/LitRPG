# Chapter 13
## The Price

The correction didn’t come immediately.

That was how Rowan knew it would be bad.

They made camp in a narrow alcove just beyond the gate—stone sloping inward like it wanted to listen. No monsters. No alarms. No text. Just the soft, damp quiet of a place the dungeon had forgotten.

Lio sat with their back against the wall, knees drawn up, staring at nothing. Their hands trembled slightly, and they kept clenching and unclenching their fists, like they were trying to ground themselves.

Kellan paced the short length of the alcove, boots scraping stone, stopping just long enough to listen before moving again. His shoulders were tense, his jaw tight. He'd been like this for hours, ever since they'd crossed the bridge.

Rowan had watched him. Cataloged the signs. The restlessness. The vigilance. The way his eyes kept scanning the shadows, looking for threats that might not be there.

She understood. She'd felt it herself, after incidents, after outages, after any moment when the system had failed and she'd had to fix it. The hypervigilance. The need to keep moving. The fear that stopping meant vulnerability.

But vulnerability wasn't the same as weakness. And stopping wasn't the same as giving up.

Rowan focused on her ankle.

The brace Aster had improvised was holding, but barely. The skin beneath it was raw and angry. Every movement sent a sharp reminder up her leg, like the system tapping her shoulder to say *I haven’t forgotten you*.

She preferred it when the system was obvious.

Rowan finished tightening the wrap and leaned back, exhaling slowly.

The overlay appeared.

Not dramatic. Not loud.

Just… present.

```
DEBT COLLECTION: INITIATED
SCOPE: COHORT
METHOD: CORRECTIVE PRESSURE (NON-LETHAL)
NOTE: OPTIMIZATION IN PROGRESS
```

Rowan closed her eyes.

“There it is,” she murmured.

Kellan stopped pacing. "What?"

Rowan didn't look at him. "It's starting."

Lio's head snapped up. "Starting what?"

Rowan opened her eyes and met Lio's gaze. She kept her voice even. "The bill."

Kellan's face went pale. "The correction?"

Rowan nodded once. "Yes."

Lio's breath hitched. "But we— we just crossed. We just survived. Why—"

"Because we survived," Rowan said. "Because we didn't do what it wanted. Because we're together."

Kellan's voice was rough. "What does that mean? What's going to happen?"

Rowan met his gaze. "I don't know. But I know it's going to hurt. And I know we're going to survive it."

Lio's eyes filled with tears. "I'm scared."

Rowan's chest tightened. "Me too. But we're scared together. That's better than being scared alone."

Kellan sank down against the wall, his legs giving out. "I don't want to do this again."

Rowan understood. He'd been through corrections before. He'd seen what they did. He'd felt what they cost.

"I know," Rowan said. "But we're not going to do it alone. We're going to do it together. And we're going to survive."

Lio's voice broke. "What if we don't?"

Rowan's throat tightened. "Then we don't. But I'm not going to let that stop us from trying."

Kellan's eyes searched her face. "You really believe that?"

Rowan met his gaze. "I have to. Because if I don't, then the system wins. And I'm not going to let it win."

Kellan swallowed. Nodded. "Okay. Together."

Rowan nodded. "Together."

The air changed.

Not all at once—just enough to notice. A subtle thickening, like the space itself had gained weight. Rowan felt it settle into her shoulders first, then her chest.

Kellan swore. “I feel—”

“I know,” Rowan said. “Don’t fight it yet.”

That was the trick. Fighting early just gave the system more data.

Lio pressed a hand to their sternum. “It’s hard to breathe.”

Rowan moved immediately, kneeling in front of them despite the protest from her ankle. She put a hand over Lio’s, grounding.

“Look at me,” Rowan said.

Lio did.

“It’s not your lungs,” Rowan said quietly. “It’s emotional load. The system’s turning the volume up.”

Lio’s eyes filled with panic. “Make it stop.”

Rowan swallowed.

She’d heard those words before. Different context. Same tone.

Rowan glanced at the empty air beside her vision.

```
SUGGESTED ACTION: REDUCE COHORT COMPLEXITY
NOTE: EFFICIENCY GAINS AVAILABLE
```

She looked away.

“No,” Rowan said aloud.

Kellan leaned against the wall, sliding down until he was sitting hard. Sweat beaded at his hairline. “Rowan… I feel like I messed up. Like—like this is my fault.”

Rowan’s chest tightened.

The system was good at that. Redirecting pain into guilt. Turning suffering into compliance.

“Hey,” Rowan said sharply. “This isn’t confession hour. Don’t narrate it.”

Kellan barked a humorless laugh. “I’m not narrating. It’s just—”

“It’s the pressure,” Rowan said. “It wants you to assign blame. That makes people smaller. Easier.”

Lio shook, breath coming fast. “I can’t— I can’t think.”

Rowan felt it then—the temptation.

Not flashy. Not malicious.

Just the quiet logic of relief.

She could give one of them up. Or both. Step forward alone. Reduce variance. Lower load.

The system would reward her for it.

Rowan remembered a hospital hallway on Earth. A white door. A gentle voice saying, “We did everything we could.” How quickly people accepted “inevitable.”

Not again.

Rowan forced herself to stay still.

The pressure spiked.

Lio cried out, clutching at their chest. Their eyes rolled back.

Rowan reacted instantly.

She caught Lio as they slumped, easing them to the ground, one arm braced under their shoulders.

“Lio,” Rowan said. “Stay with me.”

Kellan scrambled forward. “What’s happening?”

Rowan’s overlay flared brighter.

```
CORRECTIVE RESPONSE: TARGETED
ENTITY: LIO
STATUS: NON-COMPLIANT
NOTE: LOAD TRANSFER ACTIVE
```

Rowan’s stomach dropped.

“Me,” Rowan said aloud. “Take it from me.”

The system did not respond.

“She didn’t choose this.”

Still nothing.

Lio gasped, fingers digging into Rowan’s sleeve like they were drowning.

Kellan’s voice broke. “Rowan—”

“Do not let go of them.”

Rowan pulled Lio fully against her, anchoring them with her body. Pain flared in her ankle, white-hot. She welcomed it. Physical pain was honest.

“You’re not broken,” Rowan whispered. “This isn’t because you’re weak.”

Lio sobbed. “I’m sorry.”

“Don’t apologize for surviving.”

The overlay updated again.

```
NOTE: COHORT STABILITY COMPROMISED
RECOMMENDATION: REMOVE ANCHOR VARIABLE
```

Anchor variable.

Rowan went very still.

“Oh,” she said quietly. “So that’s what I am.”

The pressure surged.

Lio screamed.

Rowan tightened her hold.

Then it shifted.

Kellan let out a strangled sound and collapsed.

Rowan reached for him instinctively—and the system seized the opening.

```
LOAD REDISTRIBUTION: ACCEPTED
NOTE: COHORT STABILIZING
```

“No,” Rowan said.

Too late.

Kellan convulsed once, then went still.

Rowan's heart stopped.

She scrambled forward, ignoring the pain, ignoring the system's overlay, ignoring everything except Kellan.

She checked his breathing.

Alive.

But barely.

His pulse was weak. His skin was cold. His eyes were closed.

Rowan's hands shook as she checked him over, looking for injuries, looking for damage, looking for anything she could fix.

But there was nothing. No wounds. No blood. No physical damage.

Just… emptiness. Just… absence. Just… the system's correction.

Rowan's stomach turned.

She'd made a choice. The system had responded. Kellan had paid the price.

Rowan's eyes filled with tears.

She'd made choices before that had hurt people. She'd deployed code that had broken things. She'd made decisions that had caused outages.

But she'd always been able to fix it. To roll it back. To make it right.

This? This couldn't be fixed. This couldn't be rolled back. This couldn't be made right.

This was just… damage. Permanent. Irreversible. Real.

Rowan held Kellan's hand.

"I'm here," she whispered. "I'm not going anywhere. And I'm not going to let the system take you. Not completely. Not forever."

Kellan's fingers twitched. Just slightly. Just enough to let her know he'd heard.

Rowan's eyes filled with tears.

He was still here. Still fighting. Still present, even if only barely.

That was enough.

For now, that was enough.

But when his eyes opened, they were empty.

The overlay lingered.

```
CORRECTION COMPLETE
OUTCOME: EFFICIENCY IMPROVED
CASUALTIES: ACCEPTABLE
```

Rowan laughed once, cracked.

“That’s your price,” she whispered.

She took Kellan's hand.

"I won't forget this," she said, voice low and dangerous. "And I won't forgive it."

The system did not respond.

But somewhere, something recalculated.

Rowan stayed there for a long time, holding Kellan's hand, watching his breathing, counting his pulse, making sure he was still alive. Still present. Still fighting.

Lio eventually moved closer, sitting beside Rowan, their shoulder brushing against hers.

"I'm sorry," Lio whispered.

Rowan's head snapped up. "What? Why?"

Lio's eyes filled with tears. "Because if I wasn't here— if you'd left me— this wouldn't have happened. Kellan wouldn't be—"

"No," Rowan said, sharp. "Don't. Don't you dare."

Lio flinched.

Rowan softened her voice. "This isn't your fault. This isn't Kellan's fault. This is the system's fault. It chose to hurt him. It chose to punish us. We didn't choose this."

Lio's voice broke. "But if I'd just— if I'd just gone alone—"

"Then you'd be dead," Rowan said. "Or worse. You'd be alone. And I'd be alone. And the system would win."

Lio's face crumpled. "I don't want you to hurt because of me."

Rowan's chest tightened. "I'm not hurting because of you. I'm hurting because of the system. Because of what it did. Because of what it's trying to do."

She looked at Kellan's still form, at the emptiness in his eyes, at the way he'd gone quiet, hollow, broken.

"I chose to help you," Rowan said. "I chose to stay with you. I chose to fight the system. And I'd make that choice again. Every time. Because the alternative— leaving you, abandoning you, letting the system win— that's worse. That's worse than this."

Lio's eyes searched her face. "You really mean that?"

Rowan met their gaze. "I do. Every word."

Lio swallowed. Nodded. "Okay. Okay. Together."

Rowan nodded. "Together."

She looked back at Kellan. At his still form. At the damage the system had done.

The system thought it had won. It thought it had broken them. It thought it had made them compliant.

But it was wrong.

Rowan wasn't broken. Lio wasn't broken. Kellan wasn't broken.

They were hurt. They were damaged. They were changed.

But they weren't broken.

And as long as they weren't broken, they could keep fighting.

Rowan was going to make sure they kept fighting.

No matter what the system did.

No matter what it cost.

She'd make that choice again.

Every time.

Because that's who she was.

That's who they were.

Together.
