# Chapter 13
## The Price

The correction didn’t come immediately.

That was how Rowan knew it would be bad.

They made camp in a narrow alcove just beyond the gate—stone sloping inward like it wanted to listen. No monsters. No alarms. No text. Just the soft, damp quiet of a place the dungeon had forgotten.

Lio sat with their back against the wall, knees drawn up, staring at nothing. Kellan paced the short length of the alcove, boots scraping stone, stopping just long enough to listen before moving again.

Rowan focused on her ankle.

The brace Aster had improvised was holding, but barely. The skin beneath it was raw and angry. Every movement sent a sharp reminder up her leg, like the system tapping her shoulder to say *I haven’t forgotten you*.

She preferred it when the system was obvious.

Rowan finished tightening the wrap and leaned back, exhaling slowly.

The overlay appeared.

Not dramatic. Not loud.

Just… present.

```
DEBT COLLECTION: INITIATED
SCOPE: COHORT
METHOD: CORRECTIVE PRESSURE (NON-LETHAL)
NOTE: OPTIMIZATION IN PROGRESS
```

Rowan closed her eyes.

“There it is,” she murmured.

Kellan stopped pacing. “What?”

Rowan didn’t look at him. “It’s starting.”

Lio’s head snapped up. “Starting what?”

Rowan opened her eyes and met Lio’s gaze. She kept her voice even. “The bill.”

The air changed.

Not all at once—just enough to notice. A subtle thickening, like the space itself had gained weight. Rowan felt it settle into her shoulders first, then her chest.

Kellan swore. “I feel—”

“I know,” Rowan said. “Don’t fight it yet.”

That was the trick. Fighting early just gave the system more data.

Lio pressed a hand to their sternum. “It’s hard to breathe.”

Rowan moved immediately, kneeling in front of them despite the protest from her ankle. She put a hand over Lio’s, grounding.

“Look at me,” Rowan said.

Lio did.

“It’s not your lungs,” Rowan said quietly. “It’s emotional load. The system’s turning the volume up.”

Lio’s eyes filled with panic. “Make it stop.”

Rowan swallowed.

She’d heard those words before. Different context. Same tone.

Rowan glanced at the empty air beside her vision.

```
SUGGESTED ACTION: REDUCE COHORT COMPLEXITY
NOTE: EFFICIENCY GAINS AVAILABLE
```

She looked away.

“No,” Rowan said aloud.

Kellan leaned against the wall, sliding down until he was sitting hard. Sweat beaded at his hairline. “Rowan… I feel like I messed up. Like—like this is my fault.”

Rowan’s chest tightened.

The system was good at that. Redirecting pain into guilt. Turning suffering into compliance.

“Hey,” Rowan said sharply. “This isn’t confession hour. Don’t narrate it.”

Kellan barked a humorless laugh. “I’m not narrating. It’s just—”

“It’s the pressure,” Rowan said. “It wants you to assign blame. That makes people smaller. Easier.”

Lio shook, breath coming fast. “I can’t— I can’t think.”

Rowan felt it then—the temptation.

Not flashy. Not malicious.

Just the quiet logic of relief.

She could give one of them up. Or both. Step forward alone. Reduce variance. Lower load.

The system would reward her for it.

Rowan remembered a hospital hallway on Earth. A white door. A gentle voice saying, “We did everything we could.” How quickly people accepted “inevitable.”

Not again.

Rowan forced herself to stay still.

The pressure spiked.

Lio cried out, clutching at their chest. Their eyes rolled back.

Rowan reacted instantly.

She caught Lio as they slumped, easing them to the ground, one arm braced under their shoulders.

“Lio,” Rowan said. “Stay with me.”

Kellan scrambled forward. “What’s happening?”

Rowan’s overlay flared brighter.

```
CORRECTIVE RESPONSE: TARGETED
ENTITY: LIO
STATUS: NON-COMPLIANT
NOTE: LOAD TRANSFER ACTIVE
```

Rowan’s stomach dropped.

“Me,” Rowan said aloud. “Take it from me.”

The system did not respond.

“She didn’t choose this.”

Still nothing.

Lio gasped, fingers digging into Rowan’s sleeve like they were drowning.

Kellan’s voice broke. “Rowan—”

“Do not let go of them.”

Rowan pulled Lio fully against her, anchoring them with her body. Pain flared in her ankle, white-hot. She welcomed it. Physical pain was honest.

“You’re not broken,” Rowan whispered. “This isn’t because you’re weak.”

Lio sobbed. “I’m sorry.”

“Don’t apologize for surviving.”

The overlay updated again.

```
NOTE: COHORT STABILITY COMPROMISED
RECOMMENDATION: REMOVE ANCHOR VARIABLE
```

Anchor variable.

Rowan went very still.

“Oh,” she said quietly. “So that’s what I am.”

The pressure surged.

Lio screamed.

Rowan tightened her hold.

Then it shifted.

Kellan let out a strangled sound and collapsed.

Rowan reached for him instinctively—and the system seized the opening.

```
LOAD REDISTRIBUTION: ACCEPTED
NOTE: COHORT STABILIZING
```

“No,” Rowan said.

Too late.

Kellan convulsed once, then went still.

Rowan checked his breathing.

Alive.

But when his eyes opened, they were empty.

The overlay lingered.

```
CORRECTION COMPLETE
OUTCOME: EFFICIENCY IMPROVED
CASUALTIES: ACCEPTABLE
```

Rowan laughed once, cracked.

“That’s your price,” she whispered.

She took Kellan’s hand.

“I won’t forget this.”

The system did not respond.

But somewhere, something recalculated.
