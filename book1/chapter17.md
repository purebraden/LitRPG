# Chapter 17
## Breaking Pattern

Rowan didn’t sleep.

She rested, the way you rested during an incident—eyes closed, senses tuned outward, waiting for the next thing to break. The anomalous chamber held steady through the long stretch of quiet, its dead patches unmoving, the glow-veins continuing their erratic pulse.

The system hovered at the edge of her awareness, present but hesitant. Like a cursor blinking over an empty field.

Rowan opened her eyes and sat up slowly.

“Kellan,” she said.

He stirred, eyes opening more quickly than before. Focused enough to meet her gaze.

“Still quieter,” he murmured.

Rowan nodded. “Good.”

Lio watched them anxiously. “What are you thinking?”

Rowan looked back at the dead patch in the chamber—the place where the system’s assumptions slipped.

“I’m thinking,” she said carefully, “that it doesn’t know how to handle this.”

Lio swallowed. “Is that… bad?”

Rowan exhaled. “For us? Maybe. For it? Definitely.”

She stood, ignoring the protest from her ankle, and walked to the edge of the dead patch. The air there felt wrong—not hostile, just unfinished.

Rowan raised her hand.

Nothing happened.

No warning. No suggestion. No corrective pressure.

She smiled thinly.

“Okay,” Rowan said softly. “Let’s see what you do with this.”

She turned back to the others. “I need your help.”

Kellan frowned faintly. “With what?”

“Creating a problem,” Rowan said.

Lio’s eyes widened. “On purpose?”

“Yes.”

Rowan gestured toward the chamber entrance, where the corridor curved back toward the curated path. “The system expects movement. Progress. Resolution. What it hates most is indecision.”

She met Lio’s gaze. “We’re going to give it that.”

Rowan moved deliberately, positioning herself half in the dead patch and half out of it. Then she reached back and took Kellan’s hand.

The system noticed.

Late.

```
CONTEXT WARNING: VARIABLE COUPLING DETECTED
STATUS: ANALYZING
```

Rowan’s pulse quickened.

“Good,” she murmured.

She nodded to Lio. “Stand there.”

Lio hesitated, then obeyed, placing themselves squarely in the curated zone—the part of the chamber where the glow-veins were strongest, the system’s influence clean and confident.

Rowan watched the invisible boundary form.

Two zones.
One cohort.
Conflicting assumptions.

The overlay flickered wildly.

```
PATH INTEGRITY: DEGRADED
NOTE: COHORT DISTRIBUTION SUBOPTIMAL
```

Rowan tightened her grip on Kellan’s hand and stepped fully into the dead patch.

The pressure vanished.

Kellan gasped, then sagged with relief.

“Rowan—”

“I know,” she said. “Stay with me.”

Lio’s breath hitched from the other side of the chamber. “I feel it getting heavier.”

Rowan’s jaw clenched.

There it was.

The fork.

She could step back. Pull everyone into alignment. End the uncertainty.

Or she could hold.

The system updated, faster now, sharper.

```
CONFLICTING OBJECTIVES DETECTED
RECOMMENDATION: RESOLVE COHORT POSITION
OPTION A: CONSOLIDATE (ALIGNMENT)
OPTION B: SEPARATE (ISOLATE VARIABLE)
```

Rowan stared at the options.

Consolidate or separate.

Compliance or sacrifice.

She felt the system lean toward Option B—isolating the anomaly, pruning the branch that caused the error.

Rowan smiled without humor.

“No,” she said.

She took one deliberate step farther into the dead patch—then stopped.

Not fully gone.
Not fully present.

Halfway.

The overlay spasmed.

```
ERROR: RESOLUTION FAILED
MODEL DIVERGENCE INCREASING
```

Lio cried out, dropping to their knees. “Rowan, it hurts—”

Rowan’s chest tightened.

This was the cost.

She didn’t move.

“Kellan,” Rowan said, voice steady despite the pounding in her ears. “Talk to me.”

His fingers tightened around hers. “It’s… quiet where you are,” he said. “Loud where they are.”

Rowan nodded. “That’s the split.”

She raised her voice just enough for Lio to hear. “Lio, listen. The pressure isn’t damage. It’s coercion. Breathe through it.”

Lio sobbed but nodded, clinging to the stone. “Okay. Okay.”

The system surged, trying to force a choice.

```
CORRECTIVE INFLUENCE: ESCALATING
NOTE: DELAY INCREASES COST
```

Rowan felt the temptation slam into her—sharp, urgent.

Move.
Resolve.
End it.

She held.

Seconds stretched.

The overlay stuttered, then changed.

```
STATUS: STALLED
CONFIDENCE: LOW
ACTION: PENDING
```

Rowan’s breath caught.

It had stopped.

Not corrected.
Not punished.
Not resolved.

Stalled.

The pressure eased, just a fraction.

Lio gasped, then sucked in a deep breath. “It— it loosened.”

Kellan exhaled shakily. “Rowan… I think it doesn’t know which of us to hurt.”

Rowan closed her eyes briefly.

“Yes,” she whispered. “That’s it.”

She stepped back out of the dead patch, careful, deliberate.

The pressure returned—but weaker than before.

The overlay updated slowly, as if exhausted.

```
PATTERN BREAK CONFIRMED
NOTE: TEMPORARY INEFFICIENCY ACCEPTED
```

Rowan stared at the words.

Temporary.
Accepted.

She laughed once, breathless. “You blinked.”

The system did not deny it.

Rowan turned to Lio and helped them to their feet. Then she looked at Kellan, who was watching her with something like awe—and fear.

“That was dangerous,” he said.

Rowan nodded. “Yes.”

Lio hugged themselves. “Will it work again?”

Rowan considered. “Not like this. Not twice.”

She looked back at the dead patch, already feeling it thin, compile, resolve.

“But now,” Rowan said quietly, “I know how to make it hesitate.”

The overlay lingered one last time.

```
ANOMALY CLASSIFICATION: PERSISTENT
RESPONSE MODEL: UNDER REVIEW
```

Rowan felt a slow, steady smile spread across her face.

“Good,” she said.

Then she turned toward the corridor ahead—toward whatever the system would try next.

Because now she knew something it didn’t like admitting.

It could be wrong.
