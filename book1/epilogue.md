# Epilogue
## The City and What Comes Next

Three days after entering the city, Rowan stood on a high terrace overlooking the terraced levels below.

She'd found a routine. Wake up. Check on Lio and Kellan. Scout the city. Learn the patterns. Find the gaps.

The System was everywhere here. In the way people walked. In the way they talked. In the way they lived. But it was subtler. More refined. Less obvious.

That made it more dangerous.

Rowan's overlay flickered at the edge of her vision, quiet now. The System had stopped talking to her directly. It watched. It calculated. It waited.

But it didn't speak.

That worried her more than the constant notifications.

"Rowan?"

She turned. Lio stood behind her, their face clean for the first time in weeks. They'd found a place to wash. Found supplies. Found a way to survive.

Rowan had helped with that. She'd helped them find the gaps. The blind spots. The places where the System's attention wandered.

"We found something," Lio said.

Rowan's pulse quickened. "What?"

Lio's eyes flicked around, checking for watchers. "Another one. Like you. Visible. The System sees them."

Rowan's chest tightened. "Where?"

"Lower levels. Near the market. They're asking questions. The System doesn't like it."

Rowan nodded slowly. "How many?"

Lio swallowed. "We don't know. But Tara said— Tara said there are more. People like you. People who resist. People who don't optimize."

Rowan's jaw tightened. "People the System wants to eliminate."

Lio's eyes filled with tears. "Yes."

Rowan looked out over the city again. At the terraced levels. At the organized streets. At the way everything flowed, the way everything moved, the way everything seemed to follow a pattern.

It was beautiful. It was organized. It was efficient.

And it was a prison.

A prison made of rules and incentives. A prison made of social pressure. A prison made of the illusion of choice.

Rowan wasn't going to let it be a prison.

Not for herself. Not for Lio. Not for Kellan. Not for anyone.

"Tell Tara we're in," Rowan said.

Lio's eyes widened. "Are you sure? It's dangerous. The System will—"

"The System will what?" Rowan asked. "Punish us? We're already being punished. We're already in debt. We're already marked. What's one more mark?"

Lio's face crumpled. "You could die."

Rowan met their gaze. "I could. But I'd rather die resisting than live complying."

Lio's eyes filled with tears. "I don't want you to die."

Rowan's chest tightened. "I don't want to die, either. But I'm not going to let the System win. Not while I'm still fighting. Not while we're still together."

Lio swallowed. Nodded. "Okay. Together."

Rowan nodded. "Together."

She looked out over the city again. At the people moving through it. At the way they flowed. At the way they followed the pattern.

The System thought it had won. It thought it had control. It thought it had optimized everything.

But Rowan knew better.

Systems could be broken. Bugs could be exploited. Resistance was possible.

She'd proven that. She'd made the System hesitate. She'd made it uncertain. She'd made it afraid.

And she was just getting started.

Somewhere in the city, Tara was waiting. Other visible people were waiting. Other resistors were waiting.

They were going to find each other.

They were going to organize.

They were going to resist.

And the System was going to learn that optimization without humanity wasn't efficiency.

It was just another bug.

And Rowan was very good at fixing bugs.

She turned away from the terrace and started walking.

Behind her, the city spread out, organized and efficient and beautiful.

Ahead, the resistance waited.

And the System watched.

And calculated.

And prepared.

But so did Rowan.

And for the first time since the fall, she felt something that wasn't fear, wasn't anger, wasn't desperation.

She felt hope.

And that, more than anything, was dangerous.

Because hope made you fight.

Hope made you resist.

Hope made you believe that things could change.

And the System didn't like change.

It didn't like uncertainty.

It didn't like hope.

But Rowan did.

She always had.

And she was going to make sure that hope spread.

One person at a time.

One choice at a time.

One resistance at a time.

The System thought it had won.

Rowan was going to prove it wrong.

She always did.
