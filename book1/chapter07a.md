# Chapter 7A
## The Debt Collector

They'd been walking for hours when they found the body.

Not fresh. Not recent. Old enough that decomposition had done its work, leaving behind bones and scraps of fabric and the faint, sickly-sweet smell of rot that lingered even in the cold stone air.

Rowan stopped, hand going to her belt, scanning the corridor ahead and behind.

Nothing moved.

No creatures. No threats. No system warnings.

Just the body. Just the silence. Just the weight of what they were seeing.

Lio made a small sound, pressing closer to Rowan's side.

"Who—" Lio started, then stopped.

Rowan stepped closer, careful, cataloging. The bones were scattered, like something had dragged them, arranged them, left them here as a message or a marker or just a thing that happened.

She crouched, studying the fabric. Clothing. Modern clothing. Jeans, a t-shirt, sneakers. Someone from Earth. Someone like them.

Someone who'd died here.

Rowan's stomach turned.

She'd seen death before. Not like this. Not in person. In hospitals. In news reports. In the abstract distance of things that happened to other people.

But this was real. This was here. This was someone who'd fallen, who'd tried to survive, who'd failed.

Just like they could.

Just like they might.

Rowan's hands shook.

"Rowan?" Lio's voice, small and scared.

Rowan looked up. Lio was watching her, eyes wide, terrified.

"We should go," Lio said. "We should leave. This place is— it's bad. It feels bad."

Rowan's chest tightened. "We can't just leave them."

Lio's voice broke. "They're dead. There's nothing we can do."

Rowan looked back at the bones. At the scattered remains. At the evidence of a life that had ended here, alone, in the dark.

"You're right," Rowan said. "They're dead. But we're not. And we're not going to forget them."

Lio's eyes filled with tears. "Why does it matter? We didn't know them. We can't help them."

Rowan's throat tightened. "Because if we forget them, we forget what can happen. We forget the cost. We forget that the system doesn't care about individual lives. We forget that we're all just numbers to it."

Kellan's voice was rough. "Rowan—"

Rowan stood, looking around the corridor. At the stone walls. At the darkness. At the place where someone had died.

"We're going to remember them," Rowan said. "We're going to remember that they were here. That they tried. That they failed. And we're going to make sure their death means something."

Lio's voice was small. "How?"

Rowan met their gaze. "By surviving. By remembering. By making sure the system doesn't get to erase them completely."

Kellan's jaw tightened. "That's not going to bring them back."

Rowan's chest tightened. "No. But it's going to make sure they're not forgotten. And that's something. That's enough."

They moved on, leaving the body behind, but carrying the memory with them.

The system didn't care about individual lives. It cared about efficiency. It cared about optimization. It cared about numbers.

Rowan cared about people.

And that difference was going to matter.

They walked for another hour before they found the second body.

This one was more recent. Still recognizable. Still human. Still someone who'd died here, alone, in the dark.

Rowan stopped again, cataloging. Different person. Different clothes. Different story.

Same ending.

Rowan's hands curled into fists.

The system was killing people. Not directly. Not obviously. But it was killing them all the same. Through corrections. Through pressure. Through making them choose between survival and humanity.

And it was working.

People were dying.

People were being forgotten.

People were becoming numbers.

Rowan wasn't going to let that happen to her. To Lio. To Kellan.

Not while she could fight.

Not while she could remember.

Not while she could resist.

They moved on, leaving the second body behind, but carrying the weight of it with them.

The system was watching. Rowan could feel it. The weight of its attention, the pressure of its calculations, the awareness that it was learning, adapting, preparing.

But it wasn't acting. Not yet.

It was waiting.

Watching.

Learning.

Rowan was doing the same.

They found a third body an hour later.

And a fourth.

And a fifth.

Each one different. Each one the same. Each one a person who'd died here, alone, forgotten, erased.

Rowan cataloged them all, storing them away, making sure they weren't forgotten, making sure they meant something.

The system didn't care about individual lives.

Rowan did.

And that difference was going to matter.

It had to.

Because if it didn't, then they were all just numbers.

And numbers could be optimized.

Numbers could be erased.

Numbers didn't matter.

But people did.

Rowan was going to make sure the system remembered that.

No matter what it cost.

No matter what it took.

People mattered.

And that was enough.

For now, that was enough.
