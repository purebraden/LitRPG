# Chapter 16
## Anomalous Persistence

They'd been walking for what felt like hours when the system started lagging.

Not a dramatic failure. Not an obvious breakdown. Just... a pattern that didn't quite line up. Messages that arrived a fraction too late. Overlays that flickered, then stabilized, as if reconsidering.

Rowan noticed it the way she'd noticed bad metrics back on Earth—not as a single failure, but as something subtle, something accumulating, something that made her instincts prickle with recognition.

Like dozing with her phone next to her pillow during an on-call shift, half-waking to alerts that turned out to be false positives. That bleary uncertainty, where you weren't sure if the system was broken or just lying. Different context. Same exhaustion.

She didn't say anything at first.

They moved slowly, Kellan’s weight heavy between her and Lio. He walked when guided, feet shuffling, eyes unfocused. Sometimes he murmured under his breath, fragments without context.

Too loud.
Too many.
Make it stop.

Rowan cataloged it all automatically, even as something cold settled in her chest.

This wasn’t temporary.

This was damage.

The corridor ahead narrowed, then widened into a chamber with a low ceiling and broken stone pillars. The glow-veins here were irregular, some dark, some pulsing erratically like a failing heartbeat.

Rowan paused.

Lio looked up at her. “Why are we stopping?”

Rowan frowned slightly. “We’re not supposed to be here yet.”

Lio blinked. “How do you know?”

Rowan hesitated.

Because the system hasn’t told me what to do.
Because it’s quiet when it shouldn’t be.
Because something is missing.

She shook her head. “Instinct.”

That wasn’t entirely a lie.

Rowan’s overlay appeared late—so late she’d already taken three steps into the chamber before it resolved.

```
ZONE IDENTIFICATION: UNKNOWN
STATUS: PENDING
NOTE: DATA INCOMPLETE
```

Rowan stopped dead.

Her pulse thudded.

The system didn’t do “unknown.” Everything had a label. Everything fit into a box, even if the box was hostile.

This… wasn’t.

Lio felt her stop and nearly bumped into her. “Rowan?”

Rowan held up a hand. “Do you see anything?”

Lio glanced around, confused. “Stone? Pillars? It smells weird.”

Kellan muttered, barely audible. “Static.”

Rowan’s breath caught.

She looked at him sharply. “What did you say?”

Kellan didn’t respond. His eyes were unfocused again, but his brow furrowed, like he was listening to something no one else could hear.

Rowan turned slowly, scanning the chamber.

She saw it then.

Not text.

Absence.

A dead patch in her vision, like a spot her eyes slid around instead of focusing on. When she tried to look directly at it, her overlay stuttered.

```
WARNING: SIGNAL DEGRADATION
SOURCE: UNRESOLVED
```

Rowan’s mouth went dry.

She took a careful step toward the dead patch.

Nothing stopped her.

No pressure. No warning. No corrective nudge.

That alone was terrifying.

Lio whispered, “Rowan… I don’t like this.”

“I know,” Rowan said quietly. “Stay close.”

She reached out and brushed her fingers through the empty space.

The system didn’t react.

Instead, she felt… resistance. Not physical. Conceptual. Like pushing against an idea that hadn’t finished compiling.

Rowan sucked in a sharp breath.

On Earth, she’d once dealt with a monitoring outage caused by a race condition—two systems writing to the same state at the same time, each assuming it was the authority. The result hadn’t been clean failure.

It had been silence.

Blind spots.

People had gotten hurt because alerts never fired.

Rowan pulled her hand back slowly.

“This isn’t a correction zone,” she murmured.

Lio frowned. “Then what is it?”

Rowan swallowed. “A gap.”

Her overlay flickered again, visibly unstable now.

```
NOTE: OBSERVATION DELAY DETECTED
STATUS: REVIEWING
```

Reviewing.

The system was watching itself.

Rowan felt a chill run down her spine.

She looked back at Kellan. His breathing had steadied. His shoulders were less hunched. The frantic tension had eased, just a fraction.

“Kellan,” Rowan said softly. “How do you feel?”

He blinked slowly, eyes focusing for a heartbeat. “Quieter,” he whispered.

Rowan’s heart skipped.

Lio’s eyes widened. “Really?”

Kellan nodded faintly. “It’s… farther away.”

Rowan turned back to the dead patch, understanding dawning.

This place interfered with the system.

Not enough to break it.

Enough to confuse it.

Rowan’s overlay updated again, late and clipped.

```
ANOMALOUS CONDITION: CONFIRMED
PERSISTENCE: UNEXPECTED
NOTE: MODEL CONFIDENCE REDUCED
```

Rowan stared at the words.

Model confidence reduced.

She let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding.

“So,” she said quietly, more to herself than anyone else. “You can hesitate.”

The system did not respond.

But it didn’t correct her, either.

Rowan felt something dangerous bloom in her chest.

Hope.

She turned to Lio. “We’re staying here for a bit.”

Lio hesitated. “Is that safe?”

Rowan shook her head. “Probably not.”

Then, with grim certainty: “But it’s informative.”

She guided Kellan toward one of the broken pillars and eased him down. He didn’t resist. His breathing remained steady.

Rowan crouched nearby, watching the overlay flicker and fail to settle.

The system wasn’t gone.

It was uncertain.

And for the first time since she’d fallen into this world, Rowan realized something fundamental.

The system didn’t just enforce reality.

It depended on it behaving predictably.

Rowan leaned back against the stone and allowed herself one thin, dangerous smile.

“Found you,” she whispered.

Somewhere in the invisible architecture of the world, something recalculated.

And this time, it wasn’t sure it was right.
