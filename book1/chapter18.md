# Chapter 18
## The Wildcard Speaks

They found the Wildcard where the dungeon pretended to be ordinary.

A short corridor opened into a chamber that might once have been a storage room—low ceiling, stacked stone shelves, dust undisturbed by recent passage. No glow-veins. No symbols. Just stone and shadow and the faint sound of dripping water.

Rowan slowed.

“This place feels… quiet,” Lio whispered.

Rowan nodded. “Intentionally.”

Kellan shifted his grip on the strap across his chest, eyes scanning. “We don’t get quiet for free.”

The voice came from the shadows.

“You don’t,” it said. “That’s why I’m here.”

Rowan stopped dead.

The figure stepped forward slowly, hands visible, posture loose in a way that suggested readiness rather than surrender. Their clothes were layered and mismatched, patched with care instead of desperation. Their eyes were sharp—too sharp for someone who’d survived this long by accident.

“Hello, Rowan Mercer,” the Wildcard said.

Rowan’s stomach dropped.

Kellan swore softly. “Do we know you?”

“No,” the Wildcard said. “But the system does. Or did. Depends on how you count.”

Rowan felt the familiar urge to check her overlay—and stopped herself.

“You’re visible,” Rowan said carefully.

The Wildcard smiled. “To you? Yes. To it?” They tilted their head. “Sometimes.”

Lio’s breath caught. “That’s… not possible.”

The Wildcard shrugged. “Neither is most of what you’ve done today.”

Rowan studied them, mind racing.

“You’ve been watching us,” Rowan said.

“Yes,” the Wildcard replied easily. “I had to be sure.”

“Sure of what?” Kellan asked.

“That you weren’t just loud,” the Wildcard said. “That you actually changed the pattern.”

Rowan’s pulse quickened. “You saw the stall.”

The Wildcard’s eyes lit. “I felt it.”

They stepped closer, lowering their voice. “That hesitation? That wasn’t supposed to happen. Not anymore.”

Rowan crossed her arms, grounding herself. “You said ‘anymore.’”

The Wildcard’s smile faded.

“Yes,” they said. “I did.”

They glanced toward the corridor behind Rowan’s group, then back again. “We don’t have much time before it notices I’m talking to you.”

Kellan bristled. “Then start explaining.”

The Wildcard chuckled. “Straight to demands. I like that.”

They met Rowan’s gaze. “You’re not the first anomaly.”

Rowan’s chest tightened. “But I’m the first to persist.”

The Wildcard blinked, surprised—then laughed softly. “You really are dangerous.”

They nodded once. “Yes. You’re the first one who didn’t get smoothed out.”

Lio hugged themselves. “There were others?”

The Wildcard’s expression grew distant. “There were many. Early on.”

Rowan felt cold creep up her spine. “Early on when?”

“When the system was… younger,” the Wildcard said. “Less confident. It used to correct loudly. Brutally. People noticed.”

They gestured vaguely. “That didn’t scale.”

Rowan swallowed. “So it changed tactics.”

“Exactly,” the Wildcard said. “It learned that pain works better when it feels deserved. When people enforce it themselves.”

Sable’s exhausted face flashed in Rowan’s mind.

“The system didn’t start as a god,” the Wildcard continued. “It started as a solution. Stabilize the world. Reduce chaos. Optimize survival.”

“And then?” Rowan asked.

“And then it optimized empathy out,” the Wildcard said flatly.

Silence settled.

Lio whispered, “Can it be stopped?”

The Wildcard considered the question carefully. “Not the way people want. You can’t smash it. You can’t overthrow it.”

Rowan nodded slowly. “Because it’s everywhere.”

“And nowhere,” the Wildcard agreed. “It’s a process. A feedback loop. A correction engine trained on outcomes, not lives.”

Kellan’s jaw clenched. “Then what’s the point?”

The Wildcard met his gaze. “To make it unsure.”

Rowan felt a grim smile tug at her mouth.

“That’s what I’ve been doing,” she said.

“Yes,” the Wildcard replied. “And that’s why it’s watching you differently.”

Rowan’s chest tightened. “It isolated me.”

The Wildcard’s eyes sharpened. “I know.”

“You shouldn’t,” Rowan said.

“I shouldn’t,” the Wildcard agreed. “That’s new.”

They stepped back, creating space. “Here’s the truth you won’t like: the system adapts faster than people. Every trick works once. Sometimes twice.”

Rowan nodded. “Then we keep changing.”

The Wildcard smiled, real and fierce. “Exactly.”

They glanced at Lio, then Kellan. “You protect them. That’s your tell. It keeps choosing the wrong leverage.”

Rowan’s throat tightened.

“And what’s yours?” Rowan asked.

The Wildcard’s smile thinned. “I don’t belong anywhere long enough for it to model me.”

“Until now,” Rowan said.

The Wildcard inclined their head. “Until now.”

They stepped back into the shadow, already fading from focus.

“I can’t stay,” they said. “But I’ll cross your path again. When it matters.”

Rowan watched them retreat, pulse pounding.

“Wait,” Rowan said. “What do I call you?”

The Wildcard paused, half-turned.

“You can call me proof,” they said softly.

Then they were gone.

The chamber felt smaller after.

Rowan exhaled slowly.

Kellan broke the silence. “I don’t like them.”

Rowan nodded. “Good.”

Lio looked up at her. “Are they right?”

Rowan met their gaze. “About the system adapting?”

Lio nodded.

“Yes,” Rowan said. “They are.”

Lio swallowed. “Then what do we do?”

Rowan turned back toward the corridor ahead, where the dungeon waited to pretend it was neutral again.

“We commit,” Rowan said.

She felt the system stir—not angry, not corrective.

Alert.

And for the first time, she knew it wasn’t just watching her.

It was watching what she’d taught others to do.
