# Chapter 20
## End of Book Hook

The corridor ended without ceremony.

No boss gate. No dramatic threshold. Just a gradual widening of space until the stone walls pulled back and the air changed.

Rowan felt it first.

Not pressure. Not resistance.

Scale.

The dungeon opened into a vast, terraced cavern that stretched farther than the glow-veins could reasonably justify. Stone buildings clung to the walls in careful tiers, bridges arcing between them like ribs. Light came from everywhere and nowhere—lamps, veins, reflective crystal—enough to suggest safety without promising it.

A city.

Or something pretending to be one.

Lio stopped short, staring. “There are… people.”

There were.

Figures moved along the terraces, some alone, some in groups. Voices carried faintly—conversation, laughter, argument. Life, continuing under a ceiling of stone.

Kellan exhaled, long and shaky. “We made it.”

Rowan didn’t answer.

Cities were systems.

She scanned instinctively, cataloging flows. Choke points. Patrol routes. Resource hubs. Places where people gathered and places they were quietly discouraged from staying too long.

This wasn’t refuge.

It was governance.

As they stepped fully into the open space, Rowan’s overlay appeared.

Not abrupt.

Measured.

```
REGION TRANSITION CONFIRMED
LOCATION TYPE: POPULATION CENTER
PATH STATUS: ACTIVE
```

The words settled in the air, neutral and final.

Rowan felt the familiar chill crawl up her spine.

Lio glanced at her. “Is that… bad?”

Rowan considered. “It’s honest.”

They moved down the first terrace ramp, blending into foot traffic. No one stopped them. No one welcomed them. A few curious glances slid their way, then moved on.

Normal.

That worried her more than hostility.

The overlay updated again, slower than before.

```
DEVIATION TOLERANCE: REDUCED
CORRECTIVE INFLUENCE: ESCALATED
```

Rowan’s jaw tightened.

There it was.

The system wasn’t angry.

It was adjusting parameters.

Kellan rubbed at his temples. “I don’t like this place,” he muttered.

Rowan nodded. “You shouldn’t.”

Lio hesitated. “Can we leave?”

Rowan looked around—at the bridges, the clustered dwellings, the way movement funneled subtly toward certain paths.

“Yes,” she said. “But not without being noticed.”

They reached a small overlook where the city spread out beneath them, layered and alive. For a moment, Rowan allowed herself to simply watch.

So many people.

So many variables.

The system loved this kind of environment. Enough complexity to hide its hands. Enough normalization that resistance looked like aberration.

Rowan felt the weight of the Wildcard’s words settle again.

*Make it unsure.*

The overlay flickered one last time.

No warning.
No suggestion.

Just a quiet addition.

```
NOTE: SUBJECT PROXIMITY INCREASED
```

Rowan frowned. “Subject?”

The system did not clarify.

Lio leaned closer. “Rowan?”

Rowan forced her attention back to them, pushing the unease aside. “We keep our heads down,” she said. “We learn how this place works. And we don’t assume the system’s version of ‘normal’ is safe.”

Kellan managed a thin smile. “That sounds like a plan.”

Rowan looked out over the city again.

This was a different kind of dungeon.

One built of rules and incentives instead of claws and stone.

She felt something inside her settle—not fear, but focus.

The system had tightened its grip.

Fine.

Rowan squared her shoulders.

“Then I’ll need to be very careful,” she said quietly, “who I protect next.”
