# Chapter 15
## The Healing

They stayed in the alcove for three days.

Or maybe it was longer. Time felt unreliable here, stretched thin by exhaustion and fear and the constant awareness that the system was watching, waiting, calculating.

Rowan didn't sleep much. She couldn't. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw Kellan falling, saw the emptiness in his eyes, saw the way the system had taken something from him and left something else in its place.

She stayed close instead, watching his breathing, counting his pulse, making sure he was still alive. Still present. Still fighting.

Lio helped. They brought water when Rowan asked, sat close when she needed the contact, talked quietly when the silence got too loud.

Together, they kept watch.

Together, they survived.

On the second day, Kellan started responding.

It was small, at first. A flicker of recognition when Rowan said his name. A twitch of his fingers when she held his hand. A shift in his breathing when Lio spoke.

Rowan cataloged it all, storing it away, building a picture of what was coming back and what was staying gone.

The system had taken something. But it hadn't taken everything.

That mattered.

On the third day, Kellan spoke.

His voice was rough, broken, like he'd forgotten how to use it. But it was his voice. It was him.

"Rowan?"

Rowan's head snapped up. She'd been dozing, slumped against the wall, exhaustion finally catching up with her.

"I'm here," she said, moving closer, taking his hand. "I'm here. How are you feeling?"

Kellan's eyes focused, just for a moment. Then drifted again. "Tired. Everything's… tired."

Rowan's chest tightened. "That's okay. You're safe. We're safe. You can rest."

Kellan's brow furrowed. "The system—"

"Is gone," Rowan said. "For now. It's quiet. You can rest."

Kellan's eyes searched her face. "You're lying."

Rowan's throat tightened. "No. I'm not. The system's not here. Not right now. We're in a safe place. You can rest."

Kellan's grip tightened on her hand. "Don't leave."

Rowan's eyes filled with tears. "I'm not going anywhere. I promise."

Kellan's eyes closed. "Good. That's good."

Rowan stayed there, holding his hand, watching him sleep, making sure he was still breathing, still alive, still fighting.

Lio moved closer, sitting beside her.

"Is he going to be okay?" Lio asked.

Rowan swallowed. "I don't know. But he's getting better. That's something."

Lio's voice was small. "What did the system do to him?"

Rowan's jaw tightened. "It broke something. Something inside. Something important."

Lio's eyes filled with tears. "Can it be fixed?"

Rowan looked at Kellan. At the way he'd responded to her voice. At the way he'd held her hand. At the way he was still fighting, still present, still human.

"I don't know," Rowan said. "But I know he's not gone. I know he's still here. I know he's still fighting. And that's enough. For now, that's enough."

Lio nodded slowly. "What do we do now?"

Rowan looked around the alcove. At the stone walls. At the darkness beyond. At the place that had become their temporary sanctuary.

"We wait," Rowan said. "We heal. We rest. And then we keep going."

Lio's voice was quiet. "Where are we going?"

Rowan met their gaze. "Away from here. Away from the system. Somewhere we can be safe. Somewhere we can be free."

Lio's eyes searched her face. "Does that place exist?"

Rowan's throat tightened. "I don't know. But I'm going to find it. Or I'm going to make it."

Lio nodded. "Together?"

Rowan smiled, despite everything. "Together."

They sat there for a long time, watching Kellan sleep, making sure he was safe, making sure he was healing.

The system was gone. For now.

But it would be back. It always came back.

Rowan knew that. She'd learned that lesson the hard way.

But she also knew that they were stronger than the system thought. They were more resilient. They were more human.

And as long as they were human, as long as they could feel, as long as they could fight, they had a chance.

Rowan was going to make sure they kept that chance.

No matter what.

No matter how long it took.

They were going to heal.

They were going to recover.

They were going to survive.

Together.

Later that day, Kellan woke again.

His eyes were clearer this time, more focused, more present.

"Rowan?" he said.

"I'm here," Rowan said, moving closer. "How are you feeling?"

Kellan's brow furrowed. "Confused. Everything feels… fuzzy. Like I'm not quite here."

Rowan's chest tightened. "That's okay. You're safe. You're with us. You're healing."

Kellan's eyes searched her face. "What happened?"

Rowan swallowed. "The system corrected you. It hurt you. But you survived. And you're healing. And you're going to be okay."

Kellan's grip tightened on her hand. "I remember… pressure. Weight. Like everything was too much. Like I was drowning."

Rowan's eyes filled with tears. "I know. I'm sorry. I couldn't stop it."

Kellan's eyes focused on her. "It's not your fault."

Rowan's throat tightened. "I know. But I still feel like it is."

Kellan's hand squeezed hers. "Don't. You didn't do this. The system did. You didn't hurt me. The system hurt me. And you're here. You're helping. You're not leaving. That's enough."

Rowan's eyes filled with tears. "I'm not going anywhere. I promise."

Kellan's eyes closed. "Good. That's good."

Rowan stayed there, holding his hand, watching him rest, making sure he was safe, making sure he was healing.

The system had hurt him. It had broken something. It had changed him.

But it hadn't broken him completely. It hadn't changed him entirely. It hadn't taken everything.

He was still Kellan. He was still fighting. He was still human.

And that was enough.

For now, that was enough.

The next day, they started moving again.

Kellan could walk now, with help. His steps were slow, careful, like he was learning how to move again. But he could walk. He could move. He could survive.

That was enough.

Rowan supported him on one side, Lio on the other, and together they moved through the corridor, away from the alcove, away from the place where the system had hurt them, toward whatever came next.

The system was watching. Rowan could feel it. The weight of its attention, the pressure of its calculations, the awareness that it was learning, adapting, preparing.

But it wasn't acting. Not yet.

It was waiting.

Watching.

Learning.

Rowan was doing the same.

They were both learning how to fight.

They were both learning what the other could do.

They were both preparing for what came next.

But for now, they were moving. They were healing. They were surviving.

Together.

And that was enough.

For now, that was enough.

Rowan looked at Kellan. At the way he was walking, careful, deliberate, like he was testing each step. At the way his eyes were clearer now, more focused. At the way he was coming back to himself, piece by piece.

The system had hurt him. It had broken something. It had changed him.

But it hadn't broken him completely. It hadn't changed him entirely. It hadn't taken everything.

He was still Kellan. He was still fighting. He was still human.

And that was enough.

Rowan looked back once, at the alcove where they'd hidden, where they'd healed, where they'd learned that the system could hurt them but couldn't break them.

It was already fading into memory, becoming just another place they'd survived, just another moment they'd endured.

But it was more than that.

It was proof.

Proof that they could heal. Proof that they could recover. Proof that the system couldn't break them completely.

Rowan filed that away. Stored it. Saved it for later.

They were going to need that proof.

They were going to need that hope.

They were going to need to remember that they were stronger than the system thought.

Rowan looked ahead, at the darkness, at whatever came next.

The system was waiting.

Watching.

Learning.

But so were they.

And they were getting stronger.

They were getting smarter.

They were getting better at surviving.

Together.

The fight wasn't over.

It was just beginning.

And Rowan was ready.
