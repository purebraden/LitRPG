# Chapter 8
## The Debt Collector

They'd been walking for hours when they found the body.

The corridor had been narrowing, the glow-veins dimming to a sickly pulse. The air grew stale, tasting of old dust and something else—something metallic and wrong. Rowan's ankle throbbed with each step, the brace digging into her skin. Lio walked close, their breathing shallow and anxious. Kellan ranged ahead slightly, scanning for threats, his movements sharp with the kind of hypervigilance that came from knowing the world could turn on you in an instant.

Then they rounded a curve and saw it.

Not fresh. Not recent. Old enough that decomposition had done its work, leaving behind bones and scraps of fabric and the faint, sickly-sweet smell of rot that lingered even in the cold stone air.

Rowan stopped, hand going to her belt, scanning the corridor ahead and behind.

Nothing moved.

No creatures. No threats. No system warnings.

Just the body. Just the silence. Just the weight of what they were seeing.

Lio made a small sound, pressing closer to Rowan's side.

"Who—" Lio started, then stopped.

Rowan stepped closer, careful, cataloging. The bones were scattered, like something had dragged them, arranged them, left them here as a message or a marker or just a thing that happened.

She crouched, ignoring the protest from her ankle, and studied the fabric carefully. Clothing. Modern clothing. Jeans, dark blue, faded. A t-shirt, once white, now stained and torn. Sneakers—running shoes, the kind you'd wear for a jog or a commute. Someone from Earth. Someone like them. Someone who'd probably been thinking about normal things—work, family, groceries—right up until the moment they weren't.

Someone who'd died here.

Rowan's stomach turned. She forced herself to look closer, to catalog the details. The bones were scattered, but not randomly. Something had arranged them, or moved them, or dragged them. The skull was separate from the spine. The ribs were broken, some completely missing. The pelvis was intact, but the leg bones were fractured.

This wasn't a clean death. This was someone who'd been hurt. Badly. And then left here, alone, to die.

She'd seen death before. Not like this. Not in person. In hospitals, where it was sterile and distant. In news reports, where it was statistics and names. In the abstract distance of things that happened to other people, to people you didn't know, to people whose stories you'd never hear.

But this was real. This was here. This was someone who'd fallen, just like she had. Someone who'd tried to survive, just like she was trying. Someone who'd failed.

Just like they could.

Just like they might.

Rowan's hands shook. She pressed them flat against the stone floor, grounding herself, forcing herself to breathe.

A memory surfaced—her first production incident, years ago, when a deployment had caused a cascade failure. The alerts had started at 2 AM, and by 6 AM, customers were affected. Real people. Real accounts. Real money. She'd worked the incident, fixed the code, written the postmortem. But the thing that had stuck with her wasn't the technical details. It was the weight of knowing that somewhere, someone was dealing with the consequences of a mistake she'd made.

This felt like that. Except worse. Because this person hadn't had a choice. Hadn't had a chance to fix things. Had just... ended. Here. Alone. In the dark.

"Rowan?" Lio's voice, small and scared.

Rowan looked up. Lio was watching her, eyes wide, terrified. They'd pressed themselves against the wall, as if trying to get as far away from the body as possible without actually leaving. Their hands were shaking. Their breathing was too fast, too shallow.

Kellan had stopped a few feet away, his back to them, scanning the corridor ahead. But his shoulders were tense. He'd seen it too. Had processed it. Was trying to stay alert while his mind dealt with what they'd found.

"We should go," Lio said. "We should leave. This place is— it's bad. It feels bad."

Rowan's chest tightened. She stood slowly, her ankle protesting, and moved closer to Lio. "I know it does. But we can't just leave them."

Lio's voice broke. "They're dead. There's nothing we can do. We can't help them. We can't bring them back. What's the point of staying?"

Rowan looked back at the bones. At the scattered remains. At the evidence of a life that had ended here, alone, in the dark. At the t-shirt that had probably been clean once. At the sneakers that had probably been new. At the jeans that had probably been comfortable.

This person had had a life. Had had plans. Had had people who'd wondered where they'd gone. Had had a story that had just... stopped.

"You're right," Rowan said, voice soft. "They're dead. But we're not. And we're not going to forget them."

Kellan turned, his expression grim. "Rowan—"

"I know," Rowan cut in. "I know we need to keep moving. I know we can't afford to stop. But we can afford to remember. We can afford to acknowledge that they existed. That they mattered. That they're not just... forgotten."

Lio's eyes filled with tears. "Why does it matter? We didn't know them. We can't help them. We can't do anything for them. They're just... bones."

Rowan's throat tightened. She reached out, carefully, and put a hand on Lio's shoulder. "Because if we forget them, we forget what can happen. We forget the cost. We forget that the system doesn't care about individual lives. We forget that we're all just numbers to it."

Kellan's voice was rough. "Rowan—"

She looked at him. "No. Listen. The system wants us to forget. Wants us to see bodies and just... move on. Wants us to normalize death. Wants us to accept that some people die and that's just how it works, and we should focus on the ones who survive."

She stood, looking around the corridor. At the stone walls, cold and indifferent. At the darkness, swallowing everything. At the place where someone had died, alone, forgotten, erased.

"The system counts lives," Rowan said. "But it doesn't count them as lives. It counts them as variables. As data points. As optimization targets. This person"—she gestured to the bones—"wasn't a person to the system. They were a failure. An inefficiency. A number that didn't meet the threshold."

Lio's voice was small. "How do we make it matter?"

Rowan met their gaze. "By surviving. By remembering. By making sure the system doesn't get to erase them completely. By refusing to let death become normal. By refusing to let people become numbers."

Kellan's jaw tightened. "That's not going to bring them back."

Rowan's chest tightened. "No. But it's going to make sure they're not forgotten. It's going to make sure we remember that people matter. That lives matter. That this"—she gestured to the corridor, to the system, to everything—"isn't okay. And that's something. That's enough."

They moved on, leaving the body behind, but carrying the memory with them.

Rowan took one last look at the scattered bones, committing the details to memory. The t-shirt. The sneakers. The broken ribs. The way the bones had been arranged, as if someone—or something—had wanted them to be seen. A warning. A marker. A reminder.

Then she turned and led the way forward, her movements careful, her senses alert.

The system didn't care about individual lives. It cared about efficiency. It cared about optimization. It cared about numbers.

Rowan cared about people.

And that difference was going to matter. Not because it would change the system. But because it would change them. Because remembering the cost, acknowledging the dead, refusing to normalize death—that was how you stayed human in a world that wanted you to become efficient.

They walked in silence for a long time. Lio stayed close, their breathing slowly evening out. Kellan ranged ahead, his movements tense, as if expecting to find more bodies, more death, more reminders of what could happen.

The corridor continued, winding and dark. The glow-veins pulsed erratically, as if the system was distracted, or conserving energy, or simply didn't care about maintaining this particular path.

Rowan's overlay stayed quiet. No updates. No warnings. No suggestions. As if the system was waiting. Watching. Learning.

They walked for another hour, maybe two. Time felt unreliable in the darkness. Then they rounded another curve and saw it.

The second body.

This one was more recent. Still recognizable. Still human. A woman, maybe in her forties, her body curled in on itself as if she'd died trying to protect something. Her clothes were torn, stained with blood that had dried dark and flaky. Her hair was matted with sweat and dirt. Her hands were clenched, fingernails broken, as if she'd been fighting.

Still someone who'd died here, alone, in the dark.

Rowan stopped again, cataloging. Different person. Different clothes. Different story.

Same ending.

Lio made a small, choked sound. "Another one."

Kellan's voice was flat. "How many?"

Rowan didn't answer. She crouched, studying the body, forcing herself to look, to see, to remember. The woman had been wearing a jacket, once bright blue, now faded and torn. A wedding ring on her finger, tarnished but still there. A necklace, a small pendant, clutched in one hand.

This person had had people. Had had a life. Had had things that mattered.

And now she was just... this. A body in the dark. A warning. A reminder.

Rowan's hands curled into fists.

The system was killing people. Not directly. Not obviously. Not with claws or monsters or obvious violence. But it was killing them all the same. Through corrections. Through pressure. Through making them choose between survival and humanity. Through making them believe that caring was a weakness, that empathy was inefficiency, that people were just variables to be optimized.

And it was working.

People were dying.

People were being forgotten.

People were becoming numbers.

Rowan wasn't going to let that happen to her. To Lio. To Kellan.

Not while she could fight.

Not while she could remember.

Not while she could resist.

They moved on, leaving the second body behind, but carrying the weight of it with them.

Rowan felt it settle in her chest—the knowledge that this was deliberate. That the system had left these bodies here. That it wanted them to be seen. That it was using death as a teaching tool, as a warning, as a way to say *this is what happens to inefficient variables*.

The system was watching. Rowan could feel it. The weight of its attention, the pressure of its calculations, the awareness that it was learning, adapting, preparing.

But it wasn't acting. Not yet.

It was waiting.

Watching.

Learning.

Rowan was doing the same. Cataloging the bodies. Remembering the details. Building a picture of what the system was capable of, what it was willing to do, what it considered acceptable losses.

They found a third body an hour later. A young man, maybe early twenties, his body positioned as if he'd been running when he died.

A fourth. An older woman, her body broken in ways that suggested a fall, or an attack, or something else entirely.

A fifth. A teenager, barely more than a child, curled in on themselves as if trying to make themselves small.

Each one different. Each one with their own story, their own life, their own ending.

Each one the same. Each one a person who'd died here, alone, forgotten, erased.

Rowan cataloged them all, storing them away, making sure they weren't forgotten, making sure they meant something. The t-shirt from the first body. The wedding ring from the second. The running shoes from the third. The necklace from the fourth. The small charm bracelet from the fifth.

Details. Memories. Proof that these had been people, not just variables.

The system didn't care about individual lives.

Rowan did.

And that difference was going to matter.

It had to.

Because if it didn't, then they were all just numbers.

And numbers could be optimized.

Numbers could be erased.

Numbers didn't matter.

But people did.

Rowan was going to make sure the system remembered that. Not through violence, not through force, but through persistence. Through refusing to forget. Through refusing to normalize death. Through refusing to accept that efficiency was worth more than lives.

No matter what it cost.

No matter what it took.

People mattered.

And that was enough.

For now, that was enough.

They walked on, deeper into the darkness, and Rowan felt the weight of the system's attention settle on them like a promise.

It was keeping score.

And so was she.
