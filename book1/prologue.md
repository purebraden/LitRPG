# Prologue
## The Last Normal Moment

Rowan Mercer was thinking about a database query when the world ended.

Not a dramatic end. Not an explosion or an apocalypse or a war. Just a moment—one single, unremarkable moment—when the sidewalk gave way beneath her feet and reality decided to stop being consistent.

But before that, there was this:

She was walking home from work, the same route she took every day. Past the coffee shop that always smelled like burnt beans. Past the construction site that had been "almost done" for six months. Past the bus stop where someone had left a half-eaten sandwich on the bench.

Normal. Mundane. Utterly ordinary.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out, expecting another Slack notification about the payment system incident from last week. Instead, it was Maya.

*Still alive?*

Rowan smiled despite herself. Maya had quit three months ago, moved to a smaller company with better work-life balance. They still texted. Maya still asked if Rowan was still alive, because Rowan's job had a way of making that question relevant.

*Barely*, Rowan typed back. *Deploy went sideways. Fixed it. Standard Tuesday.*

*You should quit*, Maya replied, almost immediately.

Rowan stared at the message. She'd thought about it. More than once. But someone had to keep the systems running. Someone had to fix things when they broke. Someone had to be the person who stayed.

*Maybe next year*, she typed.

*You said that last year*, Maya replied.

Rowan didn't answer. She put her phone back in her pocket and kept walking.

The sun was low in the sky, painting everything in shades of orange and gold. The air was cold with the promise of winter. Her breath fogged in front of her.

Normal. Mundane. Utterly ordinary.

She was thinking about the database query. A slow one, eating up resources, causing performance issues. She'd spent half the day trying to optimize it, but every fix created a new problem. That was how it worked, sometimes. You fixed one thing, and something else broke. You optimized one metric, and another metric went to shit.

She was thinking about the payment system. The incident from last week. The way it had gone down during peak traffic, the way she'd spent six hours trying to bring it back up, the way her manager had thanked her and then immediately asked if she could prevent it from happening again.

As if prevention was just a matter of trying harder.

She was thinking about Maya. About the way Maya's face had looked when she'd handed in her notice. Tired. Relieved. Defeated.

Rowan had asked her why.

"I can't do this anymore," Maya had said. "I can't keep fixing things that break because someone else made a bad decision. I can't keep staying up until 3 AM because someone deployed to production on a Friday. I can't keep being the person who gets called when everything goes wrong."

Rowan had understood. She'd almost quit herself, more than once. But she'd stayed. Because someone had to. Because if she left, who would fix the things that broke?

She was thinking about all of that when the sidewalk disappeared.

One moment, solid concrete beneath her feet.

The next moment, nothing.

She fell.

The air tore past her, cold and sharp. Her stomach lurched with the certainty that this was terminal, that there was no branch to grab, no ledge, no miracle hiding in latency.

She'd read enough fantasy to know what this was supposed to be. Truck-kun. A blinding light. A voice proclaiming destiny. Some kind of explanation, some kind of reason, some kind of purpose.

But there was nothing.

Just falling.

Just the certainty that this was it, this was the end, this was how it all stopped.

No warning. No explanation. No reason.

Just failure.

Unplanned. Unceremonious.

And then—

Impact.

Pain.

Darkness.

And somewhere, in the distance, a voice that wasn't a voice, speaking words that weren't words:

*PATH ASSIGNMENT: PENDING*

But Rowan didn't hear it. Not yet.

She was too busy bleeding.

Too busy trying to breathe.

Too busy realizing that the world had just stopped making sense, and that nothing—not her engineering degree, not her years of experience, not her ability to debug complex systems—had prepared her for this.

Nothing had prepared her for the moment when reality itself became the bug she couldn't fix.

Nothing had prepared her for the fall.

But she'd learn.

She'd learn that the fall was just the beginning.

She'd learn that the System had been waiting.

She'd learn that resistance was possible, but it came at a cost.

She'd learn that she wasn't alone.

But that came later.

Right now, there was just the fall.

And the impact.

And the darkness.

And the words, floating in the air like a notification she couldn't dismiss:

*PATH ASSIGNMENT: PENDING*

Rowan didn't see them. Not yet.

But the System saw her.

And it was already calculating.

Already optimizing.

Already deciding who she would become.

But Rowan had other plans.

She always did.
