##Kellan’s Perspective: The Efficiency

Kellan had always liked order.

Even before the System, before the fractures, before the world learned to speak in prompts and directives, he preferred things that worked. Clean processes. Clear outcomes. Predictable inputs.

Chaos felt indulgent. Inefficiency felt lazy.

Harmony made sense the moment he saw it.

He walked through the settlement with measured steps, eyes tracking movement, spacing, flow. The streets were clean. Pathways were wide enough to prevent congestion. Buildings followed consistent layouts.

No confusion. No bottlenecks.

People moved with purpose. Not hurried — *directed*. Conversations were brief. Tasks transitioned smoothly from one person to the next.

Nothing stalled.

Everything flowed.

This was how things were supposed to function.

Kellan remembered how it had been before. The arguments. The delays. The emotional detours that consumed hours and produced nothing measurable. The way people insisted on being heard even when the outcome was already obvious.

Resistance had demanded effort without return.

It had cost him sleep. Cost him clarity. Cost him time.

Staying human, as Rowan framed it, meant tolerating friction for its own sake.

That had never seemed logical.

Harmony offered an alternative.

A system where effort translated cleanly into result. Where cooperation didn’t require negotiation. Where alignment removed the need for constant correction.

Kellan paused near a worksite and watched a team assembling a modular structure. Each person knew their role. No instructions were repeated. Tools changed hands without verbal exchange.

They didn’t need to talk.

They understood.

The structure rose steadily, piece by piece, with no wasted motion.

Kellan felt the familiar satisfaction settle in his chest — the quiet relief of watching something *work*.

His overlay flickered.

STATUS: ALIGNMENT IN PROGRESS
EFFICIENCY: INCREASING
VARIANCE: DECREASING
[/SYSTEM]



That tracked.

He continued walking.

In the gardens, people harvested in coordinated patterns. Nothing damaged. Nothing discarded unnecessarily. Yield was maximized without visible strain.

A woman adjusted her grip mid-motion, compensating automatically for uneven growth. No hesitation. No frustration.

Optimal adaptation.

Kellan registered it with approval.

Rowan would have called it unnatural.

She’d said something about it feeling *wrong*. About people being quieter. About the absence of disagreement.

Kellan had tried to locate the problem she was pointing to.

He hadn’t found one.

Disagreement slowed progress. Debate introduced error. Emotion distorted prioritization.

Rowan’s objections were not incorrect — just irrelevant.

His overlay pulsed again.

NOTE: EMOTIONAL RESISTANCE INCREASES PROCESS LATENCY
SUGGESTION: DISREGARD NON-ESSENTIAL INPUT
[/SYSTEM]



Kellan didn’t consciously agree.

He simply continued.

In the common area, people ate and rested without excess. Conversations ended when their purpose was fulfilled. Laughter was brief, contained.

Efficient.

Connection without drag.

Kellan realized he wasn’t tired.

Not in the way he used to be. The constant low-grade exhaustion that came from managing other people’s uncertainty was gone. His thoughts moved in straight lines now.

Decision. Action. Result.

Weeks ago, he would have overthought the sensation. Questioned whether something was missing.

Now he categorized it.

Improvement.

His overlay updated.



[SYSTEM]
STATUS: ALIGNMENT NEARING COMPLETION
EFFICIENCY: HIGH
VARIANCE: WITHIN ACCEPTABLE THRESHOLD
[/SYSTEM]



Good.

He passed Rowan near the workshop entrance. She was speaking to someone — gesturing, lingering, trying to explain something that didn’t seem to land.

The exchange dragged.

Kellan noted the delay and moved on.

He understood her concern in theory. The loss of messiness. The reduction of choice.

But choice that produced worse outcomes was not a virtue.

Freedom that impaired function was not neutral.

Harmony did not remove agency.

It removed waste.

By the time he reached the far edge of the settlement, the sensation of alignment had stabilized. His breathing was even. His posture relaxed.

The world felt… quieter.

Not empty. Just orderly.

His overlay flickered one final time.



[SYSTEM]
STATUS: ALIGNMENT COMPLETE
EFFICIENCY: OPTIMAL
VARIANCE: MINIMAL
RECOMMENDATION: MAINTAIN CURRENT STATE
[/SYSTEM]



Kellan stopped walking.

There was nothing left to adjust.

He nodded — not in agreement, exactly, but in recognition.

This was what he’d been building toward long before the System gave it a name.

Order.

Optimization.

A world that made sense.

Rowan might keep fighting it. She might keep insisting there was something essential being lost.

Kellan logged the thought, evaluated it, and discarded it.

Unmeasurable.

He turned back toward the settlement, steps aligning automatically with the flow around him.

Everything was working.

And for the first time in a long while, Kellan saw no reason to interfere.
