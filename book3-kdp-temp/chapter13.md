# Chapter 13
## River's Return

River returned from the clinic three days later.

They looked… different.

Not wrong. Not broken. Just… different.

More efficient. Less emotional. Safer.

Like a software update that promised to fix all your problems—no rollback option, but it made everything work smoothly. Like a database normalization—removing redundancy, but losing information.

But something was missing.

Rowan watched them from a distance, a weight settling in her chest. Tara stood beside her, her expression carefully neutral, her eyes watching. She'd been the one to recognize the change, to understand the cost, to see what was missing.

They moved through the settlement with purpose, their tasks coordinated, their interactions smooth. They looked like someone who'd found what they were looking for—safety, stability, peace.

But something was missing.

This was what alignment looked like.

Tara stood beside her, her movements silent, her attention focused on River. She didn't speak. She didn't need to. Rowan could see the recognition in her posture, the way her shoulders tensed slightly, the careful neutrality of her expression that didn't quite hide the understanding.

"They're aligned," Rowan said quietly, more to herself than to Tara. "They're optimized. They're at peace. But something is missing."

Tara's gaze didn't shift from River, but Rowan caught the slight nod, the acknowledgment. Connection. Empathy. Humanity. The cost was visible, even if River couldn't see it themselves yet.

Not cruelty. Not coldness.

Just… efficiency.

Just… optimization.

Just… peace.

Like code that compiled but shouldn't. Like a feature that worked perfectly but consumed resources you couldn't afford to lose.

But something was missing.

Rowan approached them, her steps careful, her attention focused. The settlement was quiet in the morning, the air crisp, the atmosphere calm. People moved around them, their movements efficient, their interactions smooth.

But River was different.

They were aligned.

They were optimized.

They were at peace.

But something was missing.

"River," Rowan said.

River looked up, their expression neutral, calm. "Rowan. Hello."

Her gut clenched.

They didn't remember.

They didn't remember the struggle.

They didn't remember the pain.

They didn't remember… her.

Like corrupted data—some files intact, some lost forever. Like a partial backup—the structure was there, but pieces were missing.

They were still River.

But they were becoming something else.

Something optimized.

Something efficient.

Something hollow.

And Rowan didn't know how to stop it.

Not while they were still in Harmony.

Not while alignment was so strong.

Not while safety was so tempting.

"River," Rowan said, her voice soft. "Do you remember me?"

River's face went still, confusion clouding their features. "I… I remember… something. Fragments. Pieces. Things that don't make sense."

Her throat closed.

They remembered fragments.

They remembered pieces.

They remembered… something.

"River," Rowan said, her voice soft. "Can I try something? Can I try to help you remember?"

River flinched, fear flickering in their eyes. "Empathy? Here? It's dangerous. It's marked. It's wrong."

Her breath caught.

They were right.

Empathy was dangerous.

But it was also necessary.

"River," Rowan said, her voice soft. "Please. Just… let me try. Just… once."

River's face crumpled. "I… I don't know. I'm scared. I'm scared of the cost. I'm scared of the danger."

Her throat closed.

They were scared.

They were scared of connection.

They were scared of feeling.

They were scared of being human.

"River," Rowan said, her voice soft. "Please."

River's face went still, desperation clouding their features. "Okay. Just… once. Just… try."

Rowan let empathy flow between them, like trying to restore corrupted data - the structure was there, but pieces were missing.

It was risky. Dangerous. Costly.

But she had to try.

Their emotions hit her like a partial backup - some data intact, some lost forever.

She found… efficiency.

Optimization.

Safety.

But beneath that, she found… pain.

Struggle.

Humanity.

They remembered, remembered choosing, remembered the cost. They regretted it, but they couldn't undo it.

A pause.

Alignment was sticky.

Once you aligned, you stayed aligned.

Recovery was possible, but incomplete.

Rowan pulled back, her movements careful, her attention focused.

River's face crumpled.

They flinched from connection, physically withdrew, emotionally lagged. Like a system with high latency - the response came, but too late to be useful.

They remembered, but with delay. They felt, but seconds late. They wanted to help, but optimization language slipped in. Like code that had been refactored - the function worked, but the variable names were wrong.

They were fighting, but alignment kept trying to reassert.

"River," Rowan said, her voice soft. "You remember."

River's face went still, desperation clouding their features. "I remember. I remember choosing. I remember the cost. I regret it. But I can't undo it. I can't go back. I'm stuck. I'm aligned. I'm… hollow."

Her throat closed.

They were stuck, aligned, hollow. But they were fighting, remembering, feeling.

"River," Rowan said, her voice soft. "Can I help you? Can I help you remember more? Can I help you resist?"

River looked up, hope flickering in their eyes. "Can you? Can you help me remember? Can you help me resist? Can you help me be… human again?"

A weight settled in her chest.

She didn't know.

But she had to try.

"River," Rowan said, her voice soft. "I'll try. I'll try to help you remember. I'll try to help you resist. I'll try to help you be human again."

River's face cleared, relief washing over them. "Thank you. Please. I don't want to be hollow. I don't want to be aligned. I want to be human. I want to feel. I want to connect."

Her throat closed.

They wanted to be human, to feel, to connect.

But alignment was sticky.

Recovery was incomplete.

Like trying to roll back a database migration—some data restored, some lost forever. Like corrupted data—some files intact, some lost forever.

They would always flinch from connection, always lag emotionally, always struggle.

Like a system with high latency—the response came, but too late to be useful. Like code that had been refactored—the function worked, but the variable names were wrong.

Sometimes it would worsen, sometimes it would embarrass them.

Sometimes it would hurt Rowan.

But they would be human.

They would feel.

They would connect.

Her breath caught.

This was the cost. Like trying to roll back a database migration - some data restored, some lost forever.

Incomplete recovery.

Sticky alignment.

Ongoing struggle.

Rowan believed it was worth it.

Because they were human.

Because they felt.

Because they connected.

But she didn't know if that belief would hold when the full cost came due.

Her hands shook.

She had to help them.

But how?

How do you help someone who's aligned?

How do you help someone who's sticky?

How do you help someone who's struggling?

Rowan didn't know.

But she had to try.

She thought about it like a system architecture problem—how do you restore corrupted data? How do you recover from a partial backup? How do you help someone remember when their memories were fading?

The answer was: you couldn't. Not perfectly. Not safely. Not efficiently.

But you could try.

You could maintain.

You could persist.

Willing to pay.

Rowan walked with River through the settlement, their steps careful, their attention focused. The gardens stretched around them, organized and efficient, but something was missing. The people worked methodically, their movements coordinated, their interactions smooth.

But they didn't touch.

They didn't connect.

They didn't feel.

Like a network where every node could communicate, but none of them actually shared data. The connections existed, but they were shallow, surface-level, optimized for efficiency rather than depth.

"River," Rowan said, her voice soft. "How are you feeling?"

River's face went still, confusion clouding their features. "I… I don't know. I feel… delayed. Like my emotions are coming seconds late. Like I'm processing things, but too slowly."

Her throat closed.

They were lagging.

Emotionally lagging.

Like a system with high latency—the response came, but too late to be useful. Like code that had been refactored—the function worked, but the variable names were wrong.

"River," Rowan said, her voice soft. "That's normal. That's part of recovery. It's going to take time. But you're remembering. You're feeling. You're connecting. That's what matters."

River looked at her, hope flickering in their eyes. "But it's so hard. I keep forgetting. I keep losing myself. I keep… aligning."

Her hands shook.

They were fighting.

They were remembering.

They were feeling.

But they were also struggling.

And alignment kept trying to reassert.

Like a memory leak consuming someone's personality—you could see it happening in real-time. Like watching someone's code slowly being overwritten—the structure was there, but something essential was missing.

"River," Rowan said, her voice soft. "I know it's hard. But you're fighting. You're remembering. You're feeling. That's what matters. That's what makes you human."

River's face crumpled. "But I'm so tired. I just want to rest. I just want to be safe. Is that so wrong?"

Her throat closed.

It wasn't wrong.

It was human.

But safety that cost connection wasn't safety.

It was surrender.

And Rowan didn't know how to stop it.

Not while they were still in Harmony.

Not while alignment was so strong.

Not while safety was so tempting.

"River," Rowan said, her voice soft. "I know you're tired. I'm tired too. But this… this isn't rest. This is giving up. And I can't do that. Not even for safety."

River looked away, their expression pained. "But I'm so tired. I just want peace."

Her hands shook.

They were so tired.

They deserved rest.

But rest that cost connection wasn't rest.

It was surrender.

And Rowan didn't know how to stop it.

Not while they were still in Harmony.

Not while alignment was so strong.

Not while safety was so tempting.

Not while she was the only one who saw the cost.

Her breath caught.

This was the cost.

Incomplete recovery.

Sticky alignment.

Ongoing struggle.

And Rowan didn't know if it was worth it.

Not while they were still in Harmony.

Not while alignment was so strong.

Not while safety was so tempting.

Not while she was the only one who saw the cost.

But she would try.

Because they were human.

Because they felt.

Because they connected.

And that mattered.

Willing to pay.

Even when it was unsustainable.

Even when it was wrong.

But River's recovery was incomplete. And Rowan didn't know if that was better or worse than complete loss. At least River remembered. At least they felt. But the lag, the flinching, the struggle—was that really better than peace?
