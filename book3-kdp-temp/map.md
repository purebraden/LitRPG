*Authorized Settlement Overview*

Harmony is a fully optimized cooperative settlement designed to maximize safety, productivity, and quality of life for aligned and non-aligned residents alike.

The settlement is organized into clearly defined functional zones, each engineered to reduce friction, minimize variance, and ensure efficient resource distribution.

Movement between zones is unrestricted and encouraged to promote stability, collaboration, and communal well-being.
